**Anchors** iOS app and the included **AnchorsUp** app extension for MobileSafari permits 
exploration and deep-linking in webpages like Wikipedia.  The **AnchorsUp** app 
extension highlights anchors, headers, and shareable points within a webpage 
that can be shared with other users or visited and shared at a later date 
from the **Anchors** app.

**Anchors** is a free-as-in-beer app made for iOS.  It is not (yet?) free-as-in-speech.  

It is currently in beta.
