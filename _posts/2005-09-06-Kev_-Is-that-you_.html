				<h1>Kev?  Is that you?</h1>
					<p>Someone please explain why I think of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060915145957/http://kev.needham.ca/">kev</a> when I read about chunky bacon in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060915145957/http://poignantguide.net/ruby/chapter-3.html"><i>Why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby</i></a>?</p>
	<p>Seriously, this is the most accessible and strange version of a Learn-a-Programming-Language book I've ever seen.   It's something I'd show to my girlfriend or sister.  (And I suspect that they'd still look at me funny, but they could grok it, if they were interested.)</p>
