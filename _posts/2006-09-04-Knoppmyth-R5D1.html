				<h1>Knoppmyth R5D1</h1>
				<p>I upgraded to the latest release, R5D1, of Knoppmyth to see if it would solve the stuttering problem that was introduced by R5C7.  Good news!  It seems to have worked!  My two test cases are causing a reschedule during playback, and listing the programs on my MythWeb server during playback.</p>
<p>Otherwise, my experience from the previous upgrades served me well - except that I didn't back up my 'Slim Server':http://www.slimdevices.com and for some reason the kernel module options required to tell one of the capture cards was using modprobe.conf instead of the update-modules command and associated directories.   Still, narrowing it down to that took an hour longer than expected. <img src="../gif/icon_sad-8.gif" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley"/> </p>
<p>I'm going to look at what it would take to build the latest and greatest build of MythTV and possibly run it, next.  Once that is done, I'll look at integrating the 'blinkenlights':http://longman.deadsquid.com/?p=245 and 'iCalendar':http://longman.deadsquid.com/?p=282 changes I've made.
