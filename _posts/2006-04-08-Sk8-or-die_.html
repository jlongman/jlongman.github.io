				<h1>Sk8 or die!</h1>
				<p>I was checking out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231725/http://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a> when I came across a link, '<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231725/http://patrick.snajder.net/blog/index.php?/archives/134-Pentose-Sugar-Is-Ocean-City.html">The Quarterlife Skateboard Crisis</a>', it struck a chord and I middle-clicked it.</p>
<p>When I got around to reading it, it was right on the button.  I'd had the same thoughts, every time I'd played Tony Hawk, when I added the eXtreme channel to the lineup, when I checked out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231725/http://www.bookofcool.com/">book of cool</a> and when I located the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231725/http://www.hour.ca/news/news.aspx?iIDArticle=6251">various</a> skate facilities in montreal.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I still haven't seen '<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231725/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt355702/">Lords of Dogtown</a>', although I've had '<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231725/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275309/">Dogtown and Z-boys</a>' forever.</p>
<p>Of course, the other thought is to pick up some new aggressive inline skates, since I <em>did</em> do that for a while.  And it was fun as far as I took it.  But then I felt old at the age of 23 when I was doing that.

								<p>Great link.  I felt the same way when I was turning 30, but unlike the author I didn't have the guts to walk into that skateboard shop (shame won over self-righteousness).</p>
<p>I don't think I could bring myself to buy one now.  But if you get one, I'm totally coming over to try it out.

								<p>It occurs to me that, thanks to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231725/http://www.tgmskateboards.com/">internet</a>, its possible to pick up the gear WITHOUT going into a store.</p>
<p>But eventually, someone is going to see you skate.  <img src="../gif/icon_smile-29.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"/>

								<p>Er, there done.  Ordered some online.  <img src="../gif/icon_smile-29.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"/>   I even picked up some extra boards as they were cheap.  Only picked up one set of trucks/wheels as they weren't so cheap.

								<p>Ah, but will they ship it in a discreet brown package?  </p>
<p>That's really cool J.  That's going to be fun.</p>
<p>Is it me, or do the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231725/http://store.tgmskateshop.com/se9fclcolo.html" rel="nofollow">longboards</a> seem especially hip?  They seem safer somehow.  I mean socially safer, of course.

								<p>I have no idea how quickly J will progress (i.e. when he'll try his first rail) but I urged him to get some kind of crotch protector. I've seen one too many hilarious videos of guys missing the rail and getting nailed. Ouch. The helmet is apparently already covered.

								<p>Good job J.  I hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>Is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231725/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275309/" title="Dogtown and Z-Boys" rel="nofollow">that</a> movie any good?</p>
<p>Not the new one.

								<p>It's definitely a very interesting insight into early skateboarding and the early players.  It's the steps after the basic introduction of skating but just before the ollie was invented.  And about when these kids from a crappy part of California became rockstars.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it. I'll try to remember to bring it this weekend.
