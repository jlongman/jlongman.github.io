				<p>Part of the Xbox Live experience is the gamercard - a total of your score across games, as well as your reputation and various images.  I stuck one underneath the gallery on the sidebar.  I <em>think</em> I'm okay with letting people know what I'm playing.</p>
<p>Kind of a neat viral marketing trick, having something you can include in your blog or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207230923/http://www.phpbb.com/">bbforum</a> (well, gamercard.net does that) postings, too.</p>
<p>Burnout Revenge is the current prospect.  I've had it about a week, and it's pretty good.  I'd love to see it in HD, and they definitely have a problem with load times, except the 'Crash' games which are intelligently done.  They have stupid mandatory score total screens which can't be interrupted.  Dumb guys, way to waste my time.
