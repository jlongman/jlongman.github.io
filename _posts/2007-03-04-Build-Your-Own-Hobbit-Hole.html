				<h1>Build Your Own Hobbit Hole</h1>
				<p>While YeeF and I were returning from climbing one evening -  something I'm trying to get started again, ever so gently - I mentioned a Hobbit-style house that I'd seen online that I thought was very interesting.  But since I've got a swiss cheese memory, I couldn't find it and only came across it again, tonight.  '<a title="pictures and desings included" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114216/http://www.simondale.net/house/index.htm">A Low Impact Woodland Home</a>'.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I find this interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Main tools used: chainsaw,        hammer and 1 inch chisel, little else really. Oh and by the way I am not        a builder or carpenter, my experience is only having a go at one similar        house 2yrs before and a bit of mucking around inbetween. This kind of building        is accessible to anyone. My main relevant skills were being able bodied,        having self belief and perseverence and a mate or two to give a lift now        and again.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a number of interesting things about it.  It's a <a title="200ad" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114216/http://www.gallica.co.uk/celts/build.htm">roundhouse</a>, built with trees, straw, rock and dirt.  It has a green roof and dirt floors.  It's low-impact and a lot of the materials were recycled from other buildings or work sites.  Lots of cools things to check out.</p>
<p>(As an aside, I found this while I was surfing.  I was looking for <a title="I still haven't looked at it... ;-)" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114216/http://www.newsoftheweird.com/">News of the Weird</a>, but was lazy and typed 'notw'.  Which turned up the <a title="I still don't know why I clicked on it..." href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114216/http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/">News Of The World</a>.  And I just clicked.  It's like car-accident-fascination I guess.  Anyways, felicity, serendipity, to whichever it can be attributed, here's the 'hobbit hole'.)
