				<h1>Fuck it, j2 out.</h1>
				<p>I'm off to just south of the tornado-torn south, specifically Rocktown in Lafayette Georgia, as of Friday at noon.  For a well-overdue, so-overdue-I-can't-add-2-+-2, vacation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, lazyweb the way into making the AppleTV a mythtv frontend (I gave up thanks to life-restrictions, but dude - release early, release often — not just-one-more-tweak-it's-a-comin'-!-my-ass), read my rss feeds for me, I think at least one farcebook connection still needs to have a baby, bonne chance avec les features, guten tag, figure out your head from your ass, and sayonara! Y no tengo tiempo para comer carne.<br/>
(I'm off to Spain for another 6 weeks, a week after I'm back)<br/>
Next weeks goals are planning vegetarian campfood, staying warm enough to be happy, reading some sci-fi, sending a soft V8 (but I'll take a fun V6), and maybe not going clear through to the dermis on <em>all</em> my fingertips this time.</p>
<p>Frankly, if Georgia remembers our visit as a passing tornado, I'll be <em>pleased</em> with the climbing vacation.</p>
