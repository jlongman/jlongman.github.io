					<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044540im_/http://shop.my-symbian.com/include/pictures/25572/celltrack.gif" alt="celltrack" align="right"/>One of the cool things taking the train through Switzerland was that your cell phone would tell you the name of the city, town or village that you were in.  I thought I would have to get a cell phone with GPS in order to get the same functionality, but it looks like the tool to do it is already here, it just needs some more software.</p>
	<p>Thus, I have to think <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044540/http://www.afischer-online.de/sos/celltrack/">this</a> is one of the coolest programs out there. (At least this minute, <img src="../gif/icon_wink-43.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley"/>  ) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044540/http://www.afischer-online.de/sos/celltrack/">CellTrack</a> is a program that tracks and logs the cell ID's you walk through.  What's missing is the correlation with your location, at least everywhere except <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044540/http://www.senderliste.de/">Germany</a>.   It seems to me that a large portion of this database will write itself, thanks to the logging. So I'm going to think about what it would take to create a database. </p>
