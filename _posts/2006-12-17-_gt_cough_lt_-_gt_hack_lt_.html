				<h1>&gt;cough&lt; &gt;hack&lt;</h1>
				<p>Not being able to breathe for a week I have developed a deeper insight into how handy lungs are.  To those around me who might benefit from some greater awareness:<a title="A different perspective..." href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808085525/http://healthbolt.net/2006/07/19/what-happens-to-your-body-if-you-stop-smoking-right-now/">What happens to your body if you stop smoking right now</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think one of the main reasons it's so hard to quit smoking is because all the benefits of quitting and all the dangers of continuing seem very far away. Well, here's a little timeline about some of the more immediate effects of quitting smoking and how that will affect your body RIGHT NOW.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also, if you need an intellectual reason to stay away from pop, the similar article about <a title="insulin shock!" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808085525/http://healthbolt.net/2006/12/08/what-happens-to-your-body-if-you-drink-a-coke-right-now/">Coke</a> is amazing.

								<p>Love the timelines.</p>
<p>Why can't you breath? (I'm guessing â€˜flu rather than, say, you've taken up smoking lately <img src="../gif/icon_smile-18.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"/> )

								<p>Definitely those timelines are one of my favourite things found online recently.</p>
<p>Yes, I've had a pretty long bought with a cold, lots of congestion.  </p>
<p>(BTW, Quebec bars are non-smoking now(!))
