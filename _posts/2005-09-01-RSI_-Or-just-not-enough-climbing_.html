				<h1>RSI?  Or just not enough climbing?</h1>
					<p><a href="ontario2005b385-3.html?page=30"><img align="right" src="../jpg/img_0549.thumb-3.jpg" alt="Niagara Glen"/></a>I basically haven't climbed all summer, except for a <a href="img_0509-3.html">day</a> or <a href="img_0550-3.html">two</a> in July, so I'm wondering if that has something to do with the discomfort I'm feeling in my forearms these days.  </p>
	<p>I've also been more active on a keyboard, both the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060915145726/http://shop.store.yahoo.com/pfuca-store/haphackeylit1.html">happy hacking</a>, and my vaio <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060915145726/http://www.dealtime.com/xPF-Sony_VAIO_505TSK_PCG_R505TSK">laptop</a> at home.  It doesn't help that the ergonomics at work are only alright.</p>
	<p>Anyways, I've found two little utilities that are helpful and free.  <br/>
<ul><li>As in beer: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060915145726/http://www.google.ca/search?q=oostime">Oostime</a>.  A simple no-frills tiny program that stops all input on windows<br/>
</li><li>As in beer, and speech: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060915145726/http://www.workrave.org/">WorkRave</a>. A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060915145726/http://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a> app ported to windows with lots of configurability, statistics, built-in exercise demos, and even supports distributed use.  And I think it was written by programmers, as it has a postpone button.  Really important so you can kick off a build before you lock yourself out.  (Is it just me, or could it also be wor-krave?)<br/>
</li></ul></p>
	<p>Of course, the next step is to see if starting climbing again helps.</p>
