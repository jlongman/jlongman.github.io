				<h1>&iquest;Qu&eacute; Tal?</h1>
				<p>So here I am in Spain, with woefully inadequate Spanish.  Nothing like necessity as motivation! <img src="../gif/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":-o" class="wp-smiley"/> </p>
<p>The people here are quite nice, and there are definitely aspects of European life I am happy to be back with like good food  (succeeding at finding vegetarian resources so far, much to the chagrin <img src="../gif/icon_wink-23.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley"/>  of my meaty friends) and attitudes and so on.  I've even got a line on a wall that is bouldered on frequently, and maybe a friend of a friend that climbs.</p>
<p>I should also note I find it ironic that I come to Europe to commute out to the suburbs - I thought that was a more North American thing, but the original contractee is resident in Castilla - la Mancha and no doubt is funded by the government, so the work location is Castilla - la Mancha, which is outside of Madrid.

								<p>Hi J,</p>
<p>I hadn't realised that you were off to Europe again. How long are you planning to be there?
