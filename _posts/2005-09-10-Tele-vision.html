				<h1>Tele-vision</h1>
					<p>Spent the day in front of the television.  It's true!</p>
	<p>At least I can say I did some cleaning while looking for the screws for my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060915150009/http://arstechnica.com/reviews/hardware/sonata.ars">Antec Sonata</a> â€“ since I decided to move my <a href="index91cd-10.html?s=myth&amp;submit=Search">Myth</a> box from the AMD Athlon XP processor on a &mu;ATX board to my Intel P4 on an ATX Asus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060915150009/http://www.asus.com/products/mb/socket478/p4p800-d/overview.htm">P4P800 Deluxe</a> (in the Sonata).  </p>
	<p>(Don't forget the ethernet driver is either the sk98lin or possibly the 3c2000!)</p>
	<p>Add to that my <a href="indexa828-15.html?p=171">new PVR-150</a>, plus a clone of an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060915150009/http://www.asterisk.org/">asterisk</a>-compatible (clone, supposedly) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060915150009/http://www.google.ca/search?q=define%3AFXO">FXO</a>, finally, maybe, giving us voicemail at home, ala <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060915150009/http://plutohome.com/">pluto</a>.</p>
	<p>Of course, I basically want to get the bttv and the ivtv tuners going, and then it's pluto.</p>
	<p>Meantime, there's a month or two of outdoor climbing left, and a whole winter left of indoor climbing.  Oh, and right now on the telly there's a show on early Saturday Night Live.  Can't wait to timeshift it and skip the commercials.</p>
	<p>Otherwise my tele-vision is Fat J and Joan, just like the Fat Americans that have been on the tv all day.</p>
