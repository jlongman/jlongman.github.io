				<h1>VOIP is so cool.</h1>
				<p>I spent my 'free time' last night arranging a VOIP line forwarded to my cell phone.  So, for roughly $3/month + $0.02/min + $0.25/min - you can call my cell phone in canada (or another number, since I've just forwarded my cell to that line) and it is automagically forwarded to my cell here in Spain.  Since incoming calls are free in Spain, for about what I'd pay in airtime in Canada, you can call my cell phone from Canada and reach me in Spain.</p>
<p>It actually took me 15 minutes to arrange, the rest of the time was choosing the number (to get a 1-800 number? for $0.03/min extra + $15 setup fee?) and just testing it.  I spent more time getting the outgoing calls (via VOIP, again) in Canada going than the whole purchase and forwarding experience, but that had something to do with the PowerPC version of X-Lite vs the Intel version.<br/>
(Notwithstanding the bad experience a co-worker had with this company - on the other hand many DIY VOIP'ers have rated it pretty well.   Also, I think I only get a 1000 forwarding minutes/month on my Canadian cell, so if I actually let that add up I'd need to give out the original VOIP line. It's actually a cool number in the pattern of 514-X1Y-1ZZ1).
