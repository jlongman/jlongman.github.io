				<h1>He'sa still one borked dude</h1>
				<p>I'd been working hard, and then I've basically not been in the mood to blog lately, and oh yeah, my body still isn't responding.  The groin is doing great, thanks for asking, but the thigh thing is still there.  The shoulders are better, but they forced me to be 100% off climbing during the best part of the season.  Anyways.  :-/</p>
<p>The only consolation is that this is making me stronger, or at least preventing things from getting worse.
