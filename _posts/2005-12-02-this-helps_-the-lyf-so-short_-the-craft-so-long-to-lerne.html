				<h1>this helps: the lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne</h1>
				<p>I've been in a mid-life crisis since going into interviews.  There's a certain value to third-party perspective putting you in your place.  Let's face it, when I thought, what will I be doing when I'm 32 years old? ... I had <em>no</em> idea what it would be.  But now that I'm here, I'm not impressed.  It seems to me I sat on my ass too much.  </p>
<p>There are too many things I haven't done, code I haven't coded, and thoughts I haven't thought and life I haven't lived.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114952/http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html">This</a>, a quick-solution anti-thesis, is the only thing I've read lately that has made me feel any better about it.  It has also been the most helpful guide on what steps I could take to get where I want, and helped with the staccato pattern of panicked heart, by bringing my expectations back into line.

								<p>Could be worse. You could still be in school at this age, and constantly have people ask you 'So, what *are* you going to do when you grow up.'</p>
<p>I suppose I wouldn't be so bothered if I had an answer.
