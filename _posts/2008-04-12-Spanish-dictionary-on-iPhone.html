				<h1>Spanish dictionary &hearts; on iPhone</h1>
				<p>I don't know why exactly I had this brainfart for so long, but I finally thought, 'surely there must be a spanish&lt;-&gt;english dictionary for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080927023521/http://code.google.com/p/wedict/">weDict</a> on the iPhone!'.   I was correct, there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080927023521/http://stardict.sourceforge.net/Dictionaries_misc.php">MANY</a> compatible dictionaries for many languages.</p>
<p>I guess I thought that someone would make all compatible dictionaries available through online repositories.  You'd think that dictionaries would be a higher priority than themes.  God knows you've got hundreds of fugly themes polluting the list of entries in the Installer.  </p>
<p>In any case, it is trivial to install the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080927023521/http://stardict.sourceforge.net/">stardict</a>-compatible dictionaries:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the tarballs and extract them.</li>
<li>Rename the <code>*.dict.dz</code> file to <code>*.dict.gz</code>.  Extract the file you just renamed - on OSX I needed to use Archive Utility and not The Unarchiver as The Unarchiver was requiring that I specify a text encoding and then failing without extracting the file.</li>
<li>  Finally you need to copy the (extracted) <code>*.dict</code> and <code>*.idx</code> file to your iPhone.  Assuming a 1.1.3 or later, it needs to go in your <code>/var/mobile/Library/weDict/</code> directory.  You can either use scp or I have afpd installed, which makes it really easy.  You want the mobile user's home directory, and then the <code>./Library/weDict</code> directory.</li>
<li>Run weDict and look for words you expect to find! Wee!  NB: with one of the dictionaries I used (i2e or e2i I believe) if searching in Spanish I needed to add the appropriate accents.  E.g. t&iacute;o (uncle) was not matched by tio.  I am testing another Spanish dictionary to see if they normalize sans-accent for utility.</li>
</ol>
<p>Too bad I did this only 4 days before I head back to the Great White North...  It definitely would have made a difference in the speed I would have picked up words!  Hasta luego...</p>

								<p>i had to do everything kinda backwards.  I changed the filenames and since i can't get afpd to activate on my ipod touch today i had to drop the files in using PhoneView.  Then I had to use the finderapp on my ipod touch to find the files and move them to the ~/Library/weDict folder.  WeDict, unfortunately, doesn't recognize them and when i search for words it says'Not Found!'<br/>
Can you help?</p>

								<p>By â€˜~' do you mean mobile's home or roots home? Be certain. If I were you I'd seriously look at using SCP - it will definitely copy the files intact.</p>
