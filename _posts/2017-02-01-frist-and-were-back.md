Hey there - frist post! (again)

So I used to have a website called 'a crick in the net' - [wayback](https://web.archive.org/web/20160714005338/http://longman.deadsquid.com/?) - so clever, I know (rolls eyes at younger self) - and I used to collect a lot of the technical and personal details of things I beat my brain against.  I'm not sure if I can recover those, if I can't, well bitrot probably means not a big loss.  But I'm still hacking forward so we might as well start it rolling again so _these_ bits can rot.

Over the last year or so I've been busy: using node.js to play with a dashboard - a [localdash](https://github.com/jlongman/atlasboard-localdash) (oh stuck it up on heroku but I'm hiding that until I get my APIkeys sorted out) ; also using node.js to download all those humblebundle ebooks - [humblebundle-ebook-downloader](https://github.com/jlongman/humblebundle-ebook-downloader); using Swift to make an iOS app called [Anchors]({{site.url}}/anchors) which lets you browse elements within a webpage; building some Arduino stuff, like a hockey timer which will switch an IR sink/receiver between two values, say music and the game, for commercials and in-between periods; an IoT version of the hockey timer (that'll be a post!); and various noodling.

# Many thanks to kev
