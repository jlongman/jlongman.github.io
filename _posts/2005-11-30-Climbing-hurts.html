				<h1>Climbing hurts</h1>
				<p>I've started climbing again.  Well, bouldering.  I've made it to the gym pretty consistently over the last month and a half.  I did a problem marked 'V4″ (a grade of difficulty, for those who are curious) - which, if that is the real grade, is pretty good considering my inconsistent exercise.  I was hoping to send a 'V6″ last night, but could only struggle through a move further than the night before.   Which isn't good, as I tried at the end of the evening the night before, and last night I should have flown up it, since I tried it much earlier in the evening.  </p>
<p>Notwithstanding, I'm probably going through a 'compensation' phase, since bouldering is hard work.</p>
<p>I did send a weird problem with an engaging  ending - the key is to throw yourself diagonally up and away from the wall.   You need to because you need the normal force in order to apply enough  friction to get the height, and then catch the edge and yourself before you fly too far away.  It was... disconcerting.</p>
<p>I saw some faces I hadn't seen in a while - coincidentally they were talking about getting back into it and were advocating routes over bouldering as bouldering can be harder on the body.   Exhibit A:  I've consistently managed to mash the flesh between the nail and the side of my fingers so bad that they are stinging painful to touch for days afterwards.  So I'm strong enough to do that damage, but haven't done enough damage yet to kill the nerves.</p>
