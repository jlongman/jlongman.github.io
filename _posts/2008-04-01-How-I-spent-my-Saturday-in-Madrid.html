				<h1>How I spent my Saturday in Madrid</h1>
				<p>And technically Sunday.  Unfortunately I couldn't make it to Italy for Clemen's and Marta's wedding, so this is what happened instead:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080723190005/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvJgzLaGAMA">El Escorial</a> - this isn't a problem we tried, but this is a guy I met and climbed with.  He's Galician, apparently, and sounds different than people from Madrid.  Nice guy, good climber!    (Thanks Cercanias, Juan, Yolande and Erin!)</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080723190005/http://es.youtube.com/watch?v=9Sj2JKce5iE">Lendakris Muertos</a> - actual footage of the event, thanks to a co-worker I got to see a Basque hardcore punk band in Madrid  (they sing in Castellano, if you're curious).  Very cool.  Almost got in a fight too.  (I don't like being passive aggressively pushed, so I passive aggressively stand my ground.)  While it's not the kind of thing I check out every week it was fun and I can see why they're popular. (Thanks Gustabo!)</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080723190005/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W82LB72MZQk">Cosmosis</a> - not actual footage (obviously) and it wasn't so day-glow, more like being in a regular club (which it was). He's actually playing the guitar live, which is cool.  I danced til about 7am (well it felt like 6am since it was the night we went to daylight savings), which is pretty good considering I'd sobered up after the beer consumed at the Lendakris Muertes show.  (Thanks Jos√©-Miguel!)</p>
<p>Not bad for a schedule that was basically improvised.  Since I was supposed to be in Italy I didn't have tickets for the L.M. show and then someone cancelled, luckily for me.  Right up until the day I thought I would not be able to get tickets, and I had no idea about the Trance thing - I was actually thinking of seeing a German DJ/Producer (T. Raumschmiere) at another club, if I could stay awake long enough (ha!). </p>
<p>PS&gt; I'm tired.</p>
