				<h1>Smuggler's Notch</h1>
				<p>The great climbing caravan made it up to Smuggler's Notch, in Stowe, VT, last weekend.  It was great!   What a change to come away from a weekend feeling great about it. (I.e. the weather held together!).  And what a great (and big!) group!  Check out g's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231900/http://gashford.net/gb/?p=74">superpost</a>.</p>
<p>I'm pretty happy about sending 'A Dirty Job', V7.  Sure it was a one-move wonder, but what a fun move and what fun to find the heel scum.  I love it when a problem seems impossible and slowly but slowly, you bend to its will and then it goes.  And sometimes it feels like the difference is you can put 2 pounds of pressure on the <em>underside</em> of an overhang, and bam, the impossible becomes ticked.</p>
<p>Speaking of the impossible - '<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231900/http://www.pbase.com/gashford/image/62540419">The Impossible Problem</a>', also V7, feels like it could go.  Interestingly, on the video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231900/http://www.concept2.com/smuggs/index.htm">here</a>, they hide the key <abbr title="Apparently climbers used to tape in betamax format in order to learn the subtleties of a climb">beta</abbr>!  Oh well, it'll be fun when it goes too.</p>
<p>A shout out to Alanna for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231900/http://www.pbase.com/gashford/image/62540399">taking one for the team</a>.  No doubt the ankle-gods will be appeased for a while and I'm sure she'll bounce back.  If not, I recommend she go the Steve Austin route.

								<p>Man, i was pissed when i watched that video.  Couldn't have changed camera angles at a worse time.</p>
<p>I talked to Bill (the guy in that video) and he said he'll give us a bunch of beta next time we're down.

								<p>It's interesting, I think that V7 is more of a 'barrier to entry' rather than a real measure of the difficulty of the problem.  That's probably generally true with problems that are one-move-wonders, but I think particularly with 'A Dirty Job'.</p>
<p>If I was living in the same city as you, you would be stronger in my way (i.e. contact strength, overhangs, dynamic moves), and I would would be stronger in your ways (longer problems, arete arches, subtle verticals and traverses).

								<p>It was a dirty job, but somebody had to do it...J apparently didn't seem to mind and made it look like such fun that Dave did it too.  I think I got part of it on video, hopefully the important bit.</p>
<p>I don't get the Steve Austin reference, unless you are refering to the 'Stone Cold' ice I am putting on it right now.  <img src="../gif/icon_wink-29.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley"/>
