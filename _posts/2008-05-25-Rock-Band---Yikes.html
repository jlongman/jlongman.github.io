				<h1>Rock Band - Yikes</h1>
				<p>Ok, it's serious fun.  But holy hardware problems:</p>
<p>The third bass pedal broke - twice, possibly three times, the same drummer.  Okay, fine: Rob, take it easy. But if the hardware can't handle noobs or over-enthusiastic players playing then it isn't ready for mass-market.  The drumsticks have gone - besides the tips chipping (probably mishits - I'm surprised the XBOX button hasn't broken as at first it seemed we were always hitting it in the middle of a song) one of the drumsticks has broken in half.  (Again, rob :-))  A lot of people complain about the guitar but I like its light action - I do find it hard to play as well with it though.  So today I bought new drumsticks and did some work on the bass pedal. </p>
<p>The first time the bass pedal broke it broke about half an inch up from the hinge.  The last two times the break happened in the same place - right beside the hinge before where any reinforcement can happen.  They definitely changed the pedal design between the original pedal and the second one, it wasn't clear whether there were changes from the second to the third.</p>
<p>So forget it: I've adapted an old high-hat pedal without cymbals that my original roommate in this apartment left behind.  The metal pedal is attached via a thick bicycle or motorcycle (probably) chain to a rod that goes up 3 feet to where the cymbals should be.  Somewhere in there is a spring.  </p>
<p>The first night we just stuck the old plastic bass pedal underneath the high hat pedal and taped the heavy magnet to the bottom of the pedal.  This worked and showed the potential of the idea, but whenever the plastic pedal and the metal pedal shifted relative to each other it was a PITA to re-align the magnet and the sensor.  So pull the sensor out of the base of the bass pedal, slap it into a old plastic Athlon64 x2 processor package, which happens to be the same width as the bass pedal supports, wedge it into the bass pedal supports and voila.  </p>
<p>The end result is (probably) a longer lasting pedal which actually has a really sweet action - it feels more responsive to pedal hits you want to hit and then doesn't hit the ones you change your mind on. Oh, it's also a bit louder than the original plastic pedal but until the neighbours complain - it's kinda cool as its metal and crunchy and hardware-y soundy.  I might see about oiling the rod the pedal is attached to though as the high hat rod that part gets HOT after a long bass-pedal intensive song.</p>
<p>I'd like to find a solid means of positioning the sensor underneath the pedal and when that is done, find a better way than taping the magnet to the (oh, right, non-magnetic metal) metal pedal. Like a hot glue gun, except once you permanently attach the magnet then the sensor CAN'T move or you have to unglue the magnet.</p>
<p>Anyways, I've picked up some new drumsticks and now we're ready to rock. I'm a little concerned that the drum head sensors will go, as they sometimes do, but... (crosses fingers)</p>
