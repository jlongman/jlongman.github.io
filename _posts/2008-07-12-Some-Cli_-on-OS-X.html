				<h1>Some Clié on OS X</h1>
				<p>I'm screwing around with an older Clié (Palm), and I am too lazy to dig out the install CD (if it's even compatible with OS X).  I found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080927023554/http://wiki.lensovet.byethost12.com/Sony_Clie_on_Mac_OS_X">some instructions</a> on how to override the tarreded (sic) behaviour of the Palm client to lock you out of that hardware, but the plist entries weren't where they said they would. </p>
<p>So, I'm still following the original instructions, so I don't know if this works yet, but if it helps someone: on Leopard, with Palm Desktop 4.2.1 Rev D for Mac, the USB entries you need to add are in /Library/Application Support/Palm HotSync/Transports/USB/Contents/Info.plist.  If you go via the Finder, you have to 'Show Contents' at least twice, they're tricky.</p>
