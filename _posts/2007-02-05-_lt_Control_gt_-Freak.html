				<h1>&lt;Control&gt;-Freak</h1>
				<p>Remember my <a title="half-way down" href="indexc544-14.html?p=259">concerns</a> about being able to get the  or  key in the 'right' place?<br/>
Well, while looking for the setting to make the Laptop/Function-keys (things like brightness, volume, etc) to default to Function-key behaviour, there it was, a little button that said, 'Modifier Keys...'.  And it does exactly what I was looking for, map  or  to that key right by my pinky finger.  And SO EASY too!</p>
<p>My next desire is a script that will change it back and forth, and then <a title="clickit!" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070208150143/http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> access to that script.  Then I'll be able to easily switch from code-mode to node-mode (the one where I sit on the couch).</p>
<p>BTW, speaking of control-freak, if you're not using Quicksilver you're a moron.  Quicksilver is like <a title="mmmm... pie." href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070208150143/http://www.piemenu.com/">pie-menu</a>s for your keyboard: a UI that works for beginners but scales effortlessly for advanced users.  It takes the search behaviour of Spotlight and applies the same search intelligence to data AND actions.</p>
<p>It doesn't replace Spotlight - it doesn't seem capable of searching my file system as efficiently as Spotlight, but I suspect that Spotlight is doing a lot of heavy-lifting behind the scenes, and one app doing that is enough of a load on my beasty.  Still I'm curious if they leverage Spotlight's DB.</p>
<p>I think there's a way to take any file from the Finder and have Quicksilver act on it, in which case the two pipeline into each other quite well.   I know you can walk the path using Quicksilver and then execute actions on things in the path...
