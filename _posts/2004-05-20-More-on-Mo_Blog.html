				<h1>More on Mo:Blog</h1>
					<p>What I would like to see from Mo:Blog is the timestamp associated with when I entered the entry, not when I uploaded it.  Really, the timestamp of when I upload something is completely uninteresting to me.  (Well, almost).  </p>
	<p>The idea is to have a gateway for the pics I generate from the palm.  I haven't been able to keep up with my blog at all in the last while, and I have barely touched a computer outside of work since my laptop's hard drive has started to do its impression of a chipmunk on speed, so I'd like this to happen automagically so I can still appear alive.</p>
	<p>Appearance is everything.</p>
