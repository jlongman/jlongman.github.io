				<h1>T600 Resuscitation?</h1>
					<p>I originally bought an Ericsson T66 while I was in France â€“ one of the tiniest phones at 59g, only a bit bigger than a Zippo.  It subsequently took me through my second (and long) trip to France and back.  Eventually I had problems with it and it was replaced under warranty with a T600.</p>
	<p>My <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044926/http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=ph&amp;lc=en&amp;ver=4000&amp;template=pp1_1_1&amp;zone=pp&amp;lm=pp1&amp;pid=9977">T600</a> has been  unable to hold a connection lately, apparently this (and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044926/http://hk.geocities.com/haha298/T600.htm">sleeping</a> problem) is pretty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044926/http://www.google.ca/search?q=t600+%22no+network%22+-treo">common</a>.  </p>
	<p><img align="left" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044926im_/http://www.sonyericsson.com/images/spgc/GPD_10554_1513_0_4000.jpg" alt="Sony Ericsson T600 "/>Well, here's my fix.  I tried to pull it apart, but I don't have any <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044926/http://www.google.ca/search?q=define%3Atorx">torx</a> screwdrivers.  So the only thing left was to prod the compartment which says 'Sony Ericsson' and is on the back, above the battery compartment.  If you stick a flathead screwdriver into the depression on panel right above the battery contact, you'll pop off the head part which ends up being the integrated antenna.  You just pull the other side out after that.  </p>
	<p>I didn't do much, scraped the surfaces with my fingers,  pushed in the spring-mounted antenna contacts, and put the top part back on.  Since then my (old) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044926/http://www.sfr.fr/">SFR</a> SIM card has been sitting in the T600 and holding the connection (at least for emergency calls).  For hours.  Which is much better than it was doing.</p>
