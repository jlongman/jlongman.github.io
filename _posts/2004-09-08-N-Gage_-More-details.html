				<h1>N-Gage: More details</h1>
					<p>A couple of things about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916043645/http://www.n-gage.com/en-CA/home/home.html">N-Gage</a>:  <ul><br/>
<li>It doesn't work with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916043645/http://www.rogers.com/">Rogers</a> GPRS</li><br/>
<li>It's a Symbian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916043645/http://www.series60.com/faq">Series 60</a> version 1.2 implementation, not version 2.0</li><br/>
<li>It supports only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916043645/http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,6566,034-3,00.html">MIDP 1.0</a>, not <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916043645/http://java.sun.com/products/midp/">MIDP 2.0</a></li><br/>
</ul></p>
	<p>Obviously having the more up-to-date stuff would be cool, more power, etc.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916043645im_/http://zarb.org/~gc/fb/pics/icon_3.gif" alt="Pingy? Is that You?" align="right"/>Still it's pretty neat, especially since I put <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916043645/http://www.frozen-bubble.org/">Frozen Bubble</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916043645/http://fb-s60.sourceforge.net/">it</a>.  Now I need to find some cheap MMC cards...</p>
