				<h1>the why not of iphone in canada</h1>
				<p>I bet you that Steve (<a title="eenteresting" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808084821/http://www.google.ca/search?q=lsd+steve+jobs">benelovently</a>, of course) dictates you <em>must</em> offer an unlimited plan.  And NOT Rogers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808084821/http://saunderslog.com/2006/02/19/when-does-unlimited-mean-unlimited/">'Unlimited'</a>.  Unlimited unlimited.  I think we'll know soon.</p>
<p>If Apple doesn't open the platform there will be a serious lack of applications compared to real smartphones.  So unlimited bandwidth is the ONLY way to compete.  Perhaps this is Steve's gift to us: truly portable data.</p>
<p>Not to be a gadget freak (B-o), but it looks like a 1-800 number forwarded to anywhere in the 48 states would be $CDN2.50/month, plus $CDN0.055/minute...  attached to an AT&amp;T plan where my parents are but roaming in Canada... Well it <strong>might</strong> almost be affordable.</p>
<p>But what a waste.  All that unlimited bandwidth not being used!</p>
<p>(Of which I've found a grand total of zero in downtown Montreal that I could connect to via my N95 yet)</p>
<p>On the other hand since 'free' wifi is more prevalent in Europe (viz <a title="nice" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808084821/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebox">Freebox</a> in France and <a title="communist wifi" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808084821/http://www.fon.com/en/">FON</a>) and if the iPhone had VOIP... Wouldn't it be funny if the non-American versions had VOIP?
