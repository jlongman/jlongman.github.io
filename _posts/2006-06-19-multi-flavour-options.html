				<p>To dual-boot (er, triple?) or to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070123204408/http://www.parallels.com/">virtual machine</a>?  </p>
<p>Neither one is perfect - for bootcamp, triple-booting is slightly fragile: there's a max number of partitions that are supported on your drive, meaning you can't create a linux swap partition, and if you're not careful you can overwrite the boot sector on the relevant drive.  They don't suggest you use NTFS.</p>
<p>For Parallels, (i.e. virtual machines) you're running a virtual machine which has some overhead, meaning you're not really getting full speed.  You need more memory.  There were some reports its not really stable yet.  (Those could be out of date though).</p>
<p>And what am I trying to achieve by doing this?  Didn't I go mac because I wanted to have a system that just worked?  At this point, as far as I know, all my tools run on OSX.  </p>
<p>There's just a few small things bother me.  One mouse button  (minor).  Fixed font sizes and screen space wastage (Maybe there's something that fixes that?).  Will I be able to remap my control key to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070123204408/http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/tor?entry=the_caps_lock_key_must">right place</a>?  (Or maybe the Command key?)  (Not to mention the multi-platform control vs. command key schizophrenia)</p>
<p>The longer I wait, the more work will be required if I need to format or re-partition.
