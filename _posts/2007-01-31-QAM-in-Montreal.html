				<h1>QAM in Montreal</h1>
				<p>I spent a bit of time goofing around with the system in order to determine whether ther's anything worth picking up on QAM in Montreal.  That's the digital encoding system used by cable operators to send digital TV.  Anywho, basically in Montreal, from a quick scan you can get: Radio and VOD advertisement channels.  Disappointing, as even if some of the local non-HD channels were available it would be an improvement in recording quality by skipping an ADA conversion.</p>
<p>The good news tho is that I can probably attach a splitter and get dual OTA HD recepetion.  Which is kinda cool, but also means that I'd need more hard disk space!</p>
<p>Besides, the real concern right now is getting a consistent signal for the shows Joan really cares about.  She gets quite emotional when they don't come in.  (Although a little searching on Torrent could solve the problem.  But, then one wonders why you pay for Cable at all, then?)

								<p>Ummm... because of the transfer rate? Waiting several hours for something that you could watch in real time in a half hour or an hour is kind of annoying, and at least here, chews up bandwidth which we could be using doing other useful things. That and the whole, 'I really want that, but no one is seeding...' I've been using torrent to keep up with some Japanese shows (actually, to get subtitles for shows I watched raw on JapanTV).</p>
<p>I suppose if you're timeshifting, that time argument doesn't matter too much.</p>
<p>We pay Rogers the bucks mainly for JapanTV. The other channels don't get much action, but buying JapanTV on its own ends up costing nearly as much as the massive 'get just about everything' package that we're subscribed to... That's a whole other story... Stupid tiering 'regulations'...

<p>ISTR reading an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070205112826/http://www.pbs.org/cringely/" rel="nofollow">I, Cringely</a> where he was examining the case of a micro-broadcaster (in toronto, methinks) and the marginal cost of each channel.   At the prices you're talking, maybe it would be worth looking into it?
