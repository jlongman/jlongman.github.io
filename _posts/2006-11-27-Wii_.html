				<h1>Wii!</h1>
				<p>Truly an embarassment of riches...  Too many games, too little time.</p>
<p>Setup was easy, except for eveything being way over wrapped.  Stupid little green tape was everywhere.</p>
<p>Joan scoured Montreal Sunday after I got up early Saturday and roused her to check out the Zellers. I saw tons of accessories, but none to be found today.<br/>
The wii-mote is pretty nifty.  I can see already (after about 20 seconds) why people would have sore arms.  The wii-mote is hefty, and it vibrates, as feedback, as your pointer passes over things on the screen.  Pretty impressive.<br/>
ps&gt; I finished Tony Hawk Project 8 at amateur level sometime late last night.

								<p>Got some wii-motes at Walmart. One of the few times I will shop there.  <img src="../gif/icon_razz.gif" alt=":-P" class="wp-smiley"/> </p>
<p>A bunch of the gang came over Tuesday night, and a Wii time was had by all, IMHO.
