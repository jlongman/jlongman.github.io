				<h1>Testing, testing, 1.2.3.</h1>
					<p>A couple of things are going on here – 1 <sup>st</sup> and foremost, I've changed to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061020203147/http://warpspire.com/hemingway">Hemingway</a> theme.  I'm not sure if I'll stay with it as I'm not convinced I can get content across with its layout but it's quite striking, I find.</p>
	<p>This was prompted by Kev upgrading my installation of Wordpress to 2.0.4 – it may be that what he did I could have done myself.  From what I see when I look at the directories, it certainly does seem that way.  But I thought he'd do some magic that allowed him to keep <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061020203147/http://www.deadsquid.com/feeds/">everyone</a> up to date at the same time.</p>
	<p>Also happening here is the use of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061020203147/http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/">Textfile</a> as a markup tool.  Using 'confluence' at work now, so I've gotten use to Textile-style markup.   The only thing is the url markup, which I prefer in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061020203147/http://www.atlassian.com/confluence/">confluence</a>.  e.g. in confluence <code>[plain text|url|title=foo]</code>, in Textile, <code>"plain text(foo)":url</code>.  It's probably something I can handle, just unfortunate that I have to attend some neurons to one, and fire a few synapses to use the other.  Oh, my, dendrites.</p>
	<p>Another essential feature, which incidentally prompted the flurry of activity, is I had gotten <strong>sick</strong> of accidentally deep-sixing a post because I had clicked on a link in the preview for testing purposes, or had accidentally refreshed the page because I do that sometimes out of habit, or am too fast while switching windows in Firefox on a Mac (cause it's really well implemented – option-propeller-[left|right arrow]).  In any case, wordpress now thoughtfully puts up a dialog confirming that I want to trash the entry.  Confluence's behaviour of saving a draft would also have been acceptable, maybe preferred.</p>
	<p>So it remains to be seen what will happen to <a href="index-646.html">my gallery</a> most recent pictures, my 'gamercard': and my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061020203147/http://www.last.fm/user/jlongman/charts/?charttype=recenttracks">last.fm</a> recently scrobbled list.</p>

								<p>Well, everyone <em>is</em> up to date, it's just that we don't use a shared WP installation for everyone (like, say, wordpress.com). This gives everyone max flexibility, but it can be a bit of a pain to make sure everyone's current (we won't even speak of gallery, although g2 is a server based install for every site but one). It is striking, but I'm not sure if I dig it or not. I shall reflect upon it, and get back to you.</p>

								<p>Neat layout. I've been thinking about switching to something cleaner, and with the 'interesting links' at the bottom rather than one side. I may yet follow suit. (This is of course <em>after</em> I complete my WordPress migration <img src="../gif/icon_smile-15.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"/> )</p>
