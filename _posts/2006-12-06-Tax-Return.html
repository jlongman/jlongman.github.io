<p>How do you prepare your return J?</p>
<p>I have used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924113934/http://www.ufile.ca/" rel="nofollow">www.ufile.ca</a></p>
<p>I liked how it was all online and how it was free for me, being a student.  I'll actually have to pay to use it for the 2006 year.  Maybe I should do it on paper and save 20.00.
