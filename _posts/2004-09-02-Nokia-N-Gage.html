				<h1>Nokia N-Gage</h1>
					<p>What a deal!  For $CDN250 you get an <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044511/http://www.thetravelinsider.info/roadwarriorcontent/unlockingfaq.htm">unlocked</a></em>, <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044511/http://www.thetravelinsider.info/roadwarriorcontent/unlockingfaq.htm#10">international</a></em> phone, with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044511/http://www.bluetooth.com/">Bluetooth</a>,  a colour screen, oh and plays games, oh and plays .WAV as a ringer!  Oh, and it runs <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044511/http://billday.com/j2me/">Java</a> Midlets...</p>
	<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044511/http://www.n-gage.ca/">N-Gage</a>.  With no <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044511/http://www.sidetalking.com/">sidetalkin'!</a>.  And I can switch back to my small phone thanks to SIM cards.</p>
	<p>I'm convinced they are selling this as a loss-leader to their games, which is kind of silly considering that I downloaded Doom for it for free last night.  Plus the Midlets you can get.   One of the criticisms as a gaming platform is that the screen is portrait, not landscape. Frankly the phone is extremely useful without buying any games.  (if a bit large, although maybe I'm biased).  I've wanted to write code for something I carry with me since I went to JavaOne uh, in 1999 when they handed out Palm V's with early J2ME implentations.</p>
	<p>(Christ, I've been doing Java for over 5 years now)  (Crap, 7).</p>
