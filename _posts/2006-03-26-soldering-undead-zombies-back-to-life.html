				<h1>soldering undead zombies back to life</h1>
				<p>Spring really is a time of re-birth:  My old <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070123204256/http://esupport.sony.com/perl/model-home.pl?mdl=PCGR505TEK&amp;LOC=3"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070123204256im_/http://www.deadsquid.com/~longman/gallery/albums/505/IMG_0761.thumb.jpg" align="right"/>P3-700 Sony Vaio 505TEK</a> 4lb laptop has been sitting <a href="505-30.html">disassembled</a> since November 2005, and today I breathed life back into it.</p>
<p>The sales on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070123204256/http://lowendmac.com/pb2/12-150.html">12â€³ G4 Powerbook</a> that are currently on ($1399 at bestbuy and compusmart) incited me to consider picking one up.  One of the primary motivations is that Joan's beast that I'm using, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070123204256/http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=307173&amp;cc=us&amp;dest_page=product&amp;docname=c00248838">Presario 900</a>, is heavy, 6.7 lb.  The problem is when I side-weight my finger, lifting the laptop, well it, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070123204256/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand#Digital_bones">the middle phalanx</a>,  feels like it slips out of the joint.  <em>Slightly</em> uncomfortable.<br/>
<a id="more-232"/><br/>
So anyways, the problem I originally thought was the power board for the Vaio, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070123204256/http://store.yahoo.com/impactcomputersmiami/a-8066-650-a.html">CNX-131</a>.  So, I was looking at the over-priced components - overpriced or Out Of Stock - fiddling with the board, looking at the option of just buying a jack which might not fit my power supply... necessitating more money...</p>
<p>Then I realized that the problem wasn't the board - it was the soldering for the jack.  When I wiggled the jack, little black outlines danced around the the soldering points of the jack on the board.  We-he-heh-heh-heh-ell...  I know what to do about that.  Dig around the closet for some solder, dig in a drawer for an iron, a soldering iron, jury rig a stand, plug-er-in... Look for my solder-sucker...  Nope.  Oh well, I'll just see what happens.  </p>
<p>Finally I ended up removing the small bit of solder I added as they'd used so much it was a non-issue.  Pushed it around and boom.  Plug it back in - just to test, and blink! blink!  Blink!  Yay!  Laptop reborn!  Uh, so now I have to actually put it all back together - hoping I can find and put all the screws back in, in the right order.</p>
<p>And, er, I don't really have a good excuse to get that sweet-sweet-gadget.

								<p>I would have thought that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070123204256/http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=asus+s5n&amp;btnG=Search+Froogle" title="Nope, still expensive" rel="nofollow">price on my laptop</a> would have decreased by now.  I've had it for over a year.  It's a really nice machine though.  I love it.
