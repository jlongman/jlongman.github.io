				<h1>Investments</h1>
				<p>Picked up some anti-gravity gear:  a new harness, since my old is getting stiff and unhappy-like, and I'm hoping to get some <del datetime="2006-03-27T21:51:31+00:00">more</del> lead climbing into my program; some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231626/http://www.flashed.com/">Flashed</a> climbing chalk - the chalk I'd been trying to track down since re-starting - this stuffs gunks itself onto your hands, 'so you don't have to'; an 'M-16″  brush — apparently the same design as that used to clean <em>the</em> rifle; some cheap athletic tape to help the tendons stay in place, even if it is placebo (can't find the reference online, anywho)... </p>
<p>Plus some non-anti-grav equipment:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231626/http://www.gashford.net/">Graham</a> twigged me onto the liquidation of certain sleeping bags at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231626/http://www.mec.ca/">MEC</a>, so I picked up a Synthetic -7 Winterhawk (i think) mummy bag - for slightly over 50 bucks - to replace the <abbr title="The North Face">TNF</abbr> Cat's Meow, which isn't so meow since compressing with age (brrrr!);  A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231626/http://www.mec.ca/Products/product_detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524441956683&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302699049&amp;bmUID=1143559804414">down vest</a> to keep me warm, since someone stole my last one while at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231626/http://www.pastamore.ca/">Pastamore</a>; a coupla shirts that Joan likes on me.</p>
<p>I'm pretty happy about being able to justify spending money on these items again.  (Not that I necessarily didn't spend money, I just couldn't justify it <img src="../gif/icon_wink-3.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley"/> )  Of course, I'll spend almost any amount of money for things which will make you happier and healthier.  It's just hard to figure out what will really do that.
