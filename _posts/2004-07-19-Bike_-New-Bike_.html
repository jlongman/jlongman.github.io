				<h1>Bike!  New Bike!</h1>
				<p>I haven't bought a new bike in over 8 years, as I figure it.  And if you think about a nice bike, it's been more like 13.  So meet my new bike...  A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070214222018/http://www.norco.com/">Norco</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070214222018/http://www.norco.com/bikes/2004bikes/napoli.htm">Napoli</a>, a 'cross-trekking' bike - a slightly modified road bike frame with a straight handle bar and mountain bike components on it.  I was just going to go for a road bike, seeing as my primary goal is biking the 15.7 km to work (according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070214222018/http://mapquest.com/">mapquest</a>, and that's taking the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070214222018/http://www.mtq.gouv.qc.ca/Etat_routes/circulation/Montreal/index_en.asp">Decarie (or 15)</a> highway.)  (And of course, Montreal is much more hilly than Ottawa is.)  â€” ahem, but I wanted to have something that was more versatile in terms of gravel trails.  Or what have you.  Because the bike has mtb-style components on it, I can fit fatter tires on it to make it act more like a hybrid.</p>
<p>So, I bought it late Saturday, but still haven't taken it for more than the test-drive spin.  It has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070214222018/http://www.chainreaction.com/pedalfaq.htm">clipless pedals</a>, and I just bought the shoes to attach myself to the bike.  Human <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070214222018/http://spooner.alltoons.co.uk/audio/stewie/cyborg.wav">cyborg</a> indeed!</p>

								<p>[...] The other thing I did while in TO was check out some of the folding bikes I've had my eye on for a while. Urbane Cycle had exactly the model I'd been drooling over on the net - the Dahon Speed Pro TT. Unfortunately, the price is higher than I hoped but closer to about what I was afraid it would be. Maybe next week I will have enough free time to test drive it to determine if it, or maybe a cheaper cousin, could replace my non-folding bike. [...]
