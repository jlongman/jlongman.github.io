				<h1>Train, skype notes</h1>
				<p>Funny, the Echo service on Skype seemed to work quite well, if a bit quiet due to ambient noise on my bluetooth headset.  But apparently a message I left on Joan's answering machine was, I'm told, quite garbled.   Maybe skype-out is fragile?</p>
<p> Charlie was pointing out that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070123204430/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Packet_Radio_Service">GPRS</a> reorders packets more readily than satellite and since the Via/Opti Wifi is a hybrid  network, it could mean that we were using a GPRS segment rather than satellite.  Given a mean ping around 500ms but a peak as high as 970ms, perhaps there simply wasn't enough buffering for the audio.
