				<h1>Power!</h1>
				<p><img src="../png/consumption-3.png" alt="Power consumption, 2004 in light blue, and 2005 in dark blue, vertical axis in kWh" title="2004 in light blue, 2005 in dark blue, the vertical axis is real kWh consumed."/></p>
<p>The above graph basically shows that we've reduced the power consumption by about 40% since December.</p>
<p>I attribute the dramatic difference to a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I sealed the skylight with plastic during the winter</li>
<li>I installed an electronically-controlled thermostat on the sleeping side of the apartment</li>
<li>The radiators (which I don't pay for) worked better this year</li>
<li>Joan has done her part by reducing the use of the dryer</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm <em>really</em> happy about this, and I'm looking forward to seeing what difference the more efficient refrigerator makes.  (oh, it's conceivable there could be little change, or even an increase, in power consumption because the new fridge is larger than the old, but I doubt it).</p>
<p>And we don't have an AC, as my place would be nearly impossible to cool, but I think blocking the <a href="../other/skylight-2">skylight</a> with reflective <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195256/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/roofs+walls/radiant/">radiant barrier</a> will make a difference in comfort level this year also. </p>
<p>(I'm aware that my installation of the radiant barrier isn't ideal, but I still believe it represents a net gain over not having it - and I can't see that 'proper' installation would make much of  a difference.)

								<p>Thx for the book recommendation, impressed that your green footprint is so small.  Nice clean graph design, Edward Tufte would be proud.

								<p>Ya, I can't take credit for the graph - Hydro Quebec actually does it for me.  It's quite possible I am violating copyright here.  (oops)</p>
<p>I just went back through my site, and realized that the electronic thermostats, and low-flo shower head (which I forgot to mention) were installed around March 1st, 2005.</p>
<p>There's no significant difference noticable in the graph, associated with these, but its not clear how Hydro was delineating the month of March (i.e. I believe that the reading is done mid-March, but what is March? I believe the reading is <em>mid</em>-March... so?)</p>
<p>Actually I think the most telling is that once the outside temperature is no longer a factor, what remains should be purely constant power usage - assumption: I'm still going to take the same amount of showers, wash the same amount of dishes and use television the same amount (little, <img src="../gif/icon_razz-7.gif" alt=":-P" class="wp-smiley"/> ) in winter or summer. </p>
<p>It's almost true - except in the extreme temperatures where the fridge has to work harder, and the fans are on - but that is only true when the inside temperature is &gt;  25 &deg;C.

								<p>[...] Hydro has a wonderful client webpage that allows you to do all kinds of great things like look at your consumption. Unfortunately, they require a password with a number, unlike any of my other utilities. I generally do use different passwords with my utilities but I mix usernames and passwords up a lot between them, so typically it takes a while to get the right username and password combination.

								<p>[...] Looking back at the last time I did a power consumption review, it's a vast improvement from 2004, but we've slipped slightly since 2005. There are probably a couple of factors here: using more fans (during the summer) and using MythTV, I imagine since the machine is always on. We've also gotten more comfortable with the convection oven for cooking and other cooking appliances. [...]
