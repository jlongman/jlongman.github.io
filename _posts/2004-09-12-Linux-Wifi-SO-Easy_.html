				<h1>Linux Wifi SO Easy!</h1>
					<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044608im_/http://www.edimax.com.tw/download/others/WiFi icon.gif" alt="wifi" align="left"/>I <st>can't</st> believe it.  The hardest thing about configuring the wifi was finding the UI to do it.  It helps I'm using old hardware, but WOW!!!  It was SO much easier than past times I've tried to do it. </p>
	<p>Surprisingly, just getting the icons to work in Gnome was all screwed up.  It worked the first time, but after that nada.  Creating a new account managed to get me around the problem.  </p>
	<p>I suspect it had something to do with my key repeat configuration failing.  My theory is that somehow the schema for gconf2 (Gnome Configuration?) was in the wrong place. And as the schema is supposed to tell it what type of parameter the saved configuration is, while passing data to the process which applies the configuration, the process which applies the configuration was complaining that the wrong type was passed.</p>
	<p>(What interesting word usements I structure.)</p>
	<p>I followed the Linux battery <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044608/http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Battery-Powered/">mini-howto</a> and that took me to about 1am last night.<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044608im_/http://www.kodak.com/global/images/en/service/digCam/mc3/ownerManual/batteryLowIcon.gif" alt="battery munchey" align="right"/> The only thing REALLY left was the fact that I couldn't control the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044608/http://popies.net/sonypi/">brightness</a> on my machine.  Ends up I had configurations in the wrong file.  Now I just hav e to figure out how to boot up like that.</p>
	<p>Oh and I want to install <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044608/http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> to see if I could develop on this thing.</p>
	<p>Or maybe I'll get that powerbook... <img src="../gif/icon_smile-2.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"/>   (Ha!)</p>
