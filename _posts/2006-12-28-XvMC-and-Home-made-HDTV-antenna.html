				<h1>XvMC and Home-made HDTV antenna</h1>
				<p>I <a title="see the comment" href="indexe2aa-8.html?p=294">switched the video cards</a> and the system looks like it is doing quite well - almost - the digital audio keeps dropping out.  At this point I'm wondering if this is an IRQ problem as a couple of things which are sharing IRQs (the video card and the capture cards) are sharing irq's.  Or it could be a PCI bandwidth/latency problem.  Or it could be the wrong driver.</p>
<p>I tried rolling back to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808085154/http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/XvMC">popular</a> driver (v. 7676) but it doesn't look compatible with a 2.6 kernel, so I went to the next recommended one.  Knoppmyth R5E-whatever was released, but I don't have any CD-Rs right now.  I don't know if it would help anyways (especially since I am running an SVN version).</p>
<p>While I'm percolating on whether to solve the entire problem by throwing money at it (a new mobo, massive cpu, etc), I decided to see what I could do about raw reception.   Somewhere on <a title="awesome site" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808085154/http://www.avsforum.com/">avsforum</a> or possibly <a title="cool!" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808085154/http://www.instructables.com/">instructables</a> I saw a link to <a title="antenna instructions" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808085154/http://www.lumenlab.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=9613">this</a> set of instructions on how to build a DIY antenna.</p>
<p>I dropped by the Home Depot to pickup a <a title="like this one" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808085154/http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2062049&amp;cp=&amp;kw=matching+transformer&amp;parentPage=search">FM modulator to coax converter</a> and a couple of screws and washers.  I should have picked up a saw.</p>
<p>Anyways, I scanned the instructions and then decided to improvise on a piece of styrofoam I had around the house instead of cardboard.  Any cardboard of a suitable size was already attached to a box, and <em>someday</em> we'll need them to move.</p>
<p>The styrofoam was great, except the original design had the backing support wood screwed to the front pieces.  I dug up some 4 inch deck screws we'd used on the climbing wall and went to find some aluminum foil.</p>
<p>I had a huge roll of vapour barrier from solar insulating the skylight and windows in the summer.  A perfect substitute for aluminum foil.</p>
<p>When it got to the wood part Joan's brother Willy had over-estimated how much we'd need for a project to seal the skylight so I had tons of the perfect size.   Except no saw.  I first tried a serrated multi-tool knife blade which looked like it was going to work great, except the wood split down the middle when I tried to just cut a couple of millimeters and then force it by weight.  No surprise.</p>
<p>Next inspiration was to use the drill to do high-density horizontal, vertical and diagonal holes until it came apart easily.  Then a quick file and it was ugly^H^H^H^Hacceptable.</p>
<p><a href="main63f5.html?g2_view=core:ShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=4161"><img align="right" alt="antenna" src="../jpg/img_6423c872.jpg?g2_view=core:DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=4173&amp;g2_serialNumber=2"/></a>Everything else was pretty straight-forward.  It was pretty cool how it came together.  Finally, the piece-de-resistance, attach the converter, sit it down on the table, unplug the amplified antenna that was plugged into the HDHomeRun and plug it in.</p>
<p>I have to say, I'm impressed.   Before I received CBC, which is transmitting from a couple of blocks away, and barely received the carrier for a US channel.</p>

<p>After (unamplified DIY antenna):</p>
<p>8vsb:14: ss=71 snq=30 seq=100<br/>
program 8vsb:14-4 5.1 WPTZ-HD filter='0×0000 0×0032 0×0033 0×0035″<br/>
program 8vsb:14-7 5.2 WPTZ-WX filter='0×0000 0×0041 0×0042 0×0046″<br/>
8vsb:19: ss=100 snq=80 seq=100<br/>
program 8vsb:19-3 2.1 CBFT-DT filter='0×0000 0×0030 0×0031 0×0034″<br/>
8vsb:20: ss=100 snq=90 seq=100<br/>
program 8vsb:20-3 6.1 CBMT-HD filter='0×0000 0×0030 0×0031 0×0034 0×0035″<br/>
8vsb:32: ss=60 snq=15 seq=0<br/>
8vsb:43: ss=4 snq=10 seq=0<br/>
8vsb:55: ss=97 snq=90 seq=100<br/>
program 8vsb:55-3 6.1 CBMT-HD filter='0×0000 0×0030 0×0031 0×0034 0×0035″</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can't tell what those channels are as <a title="a great source for canadian geekery" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808085154/http://www.digitalhome.ca/">digital home canada</a> is down for maintenance.  I should point out, I think this is a directional antenna, and all I've done so far is <em>point it up</em>.  The next plan is to unseal the skylight and point it out there, in a southerly direction.  Oh and get that HD playback working correctly!
