				<h1>Changing Myth Distributions?</h1>
				<p>Every one else is out of town and my car was hit while parked (and the insurance company is 'busy') so I missed two (so far this weekend) great bouldering days but I did play with the AppleTV and getting MythTV running on it (using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080927023531/http://code.google.com/p/atv-bootloader/">atv-bootloader</a>).  </p>
<p>With the help of davilla I installed it all and got it booting from a CD, including the recent Mythbuntu 8.04 (a MythTV 0.21-release). Which is unfortunately a newer release than my backend (a MythTV 0.20-fixes release on Knoppmyth R5F27).  Knoppmyth is releasing a release called R5.5 containing 0.21 RSN (real soon now), but maybe I'll give MythBuntu a shot.  Honestly, I haven't found a good comparison and my friend Rob, who has tried both, has mentioned good and bad points for each.</p>
<p>Oh, in case it's not clear, the motivation for 0.21 is about getting the best performance out of the AppleTV, or at least being current with progress and getting support from other AppleTV/MythTV users.  </p>
<p>The AppleTV is capable of decoding 1080i or 720p at less than 28 watts, and about $250.  Compare that with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080927023531/http://www.linuxmce.org/">LinuxMCE</a> (also interesting) box with similar or lesser specs and footpring being sold commercially for about $500.</p>
