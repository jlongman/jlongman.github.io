				<h1>Dear Friend,</h1>
				<p>Been climbing?</p>
<p>I picked up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231830/http://www.metoliusclimbing.com/behemoth_pad.htm">Metolius Behemoth</a> pad (TOO BIG!) and hit Val David last (er: last, last) weekend.  Ran into people from the gym in morreal, so it was like a session.  <img src="../gif/icon_smile-28.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"/>  </p>
<p>The bugs were crazy!  Highlight, sent V5 'T&eacute; Ou?'. Got on Poph-tart V5 but was a bit psyched by the rock behind you, nearly sent Rhythmix V5 but it was just too hot.  Lowlight, by the end of the day after everyone else left I was still climbing when I couldn't take it anymore and ran screaming from the woods.</p>
<p>And my pad is almost too big.  I thought big would be good if I climbed solo and didn't run into anyone up there.  But it barely fits in the back of my friend's  coupe. Damn those impulse purchases!

								<p>'T&eacute; Ou?' is on the Francoise boulder roughly between 'Louise Classique' and 'Poph-Tart'.  It's a reddish boulder with a V8 ('T&eacute; chaud Paul?') on the corner and a V10 ('&Ocirc;couto') underneath the roof where you start 'T&eacute; Ou?'.  'T.O'. goes up the middle and exits rightish.  'Rhythmix' is maybe 15 feet from it.</p>
<p>I didn't get [back] on 'Louise Classique' as I was alone by the time I made it over there.  I was bit psyched out by the rock behind it.

								<p>Been trying to find pictures of some of the problems mentioned that you haven't seen.</p>
<p>I suspect you're working Poubelle T&eacute; Ou? in the V4 in your pics, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231830/http://www.pbase.com/gashford/val_david_jul_10_2005" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbase.com/gashford/val_david_jul_10_2005</a></p>
