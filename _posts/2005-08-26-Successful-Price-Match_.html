				<h1>Successful Price Match!</h1>
					<p>I've been eye-ing the Hauppauge PVR-x50 line for a while â€“ its a TV Tuner with an onboard MythTV-compatible MPEG-2 encoder which means very little load on the processor.  I already have a TV Tuner card without an onboard encoder, which means a software encoder.  So this means I could watch and pause live TV while recording a program in the background.</p>
	<p>First, and probably last, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060915150346/http://www.staples.ca/">stOOpleS</a> price match.  Their price match policy is 150% of the difference (well, for a bit longer).  So if Futureshop has it for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060915150346/http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetail.asp?logon=&amp;langid=EN&amp;sku_id=0665000FS10057681&amp;catid=">$99</a>, Staples has it for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060915150346/http://www.staples.ca/ENG/Catalog/cat_sku.asp?CatIds=,&amp;webid=598522&amp;affixedcode=WW">$149</a>, well, I paid $75.01.  (149-99 = 50 * 1.5 = 75)</p>
	<p>So I now have a dual-tuner <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060915150346/http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> PVR!  Oh, I guess we'll have to get cable or something now.  Damn you <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060915150346/http://www.redflagdeals.com/">redflag!</a>  (I actually saw this before it was posted there, woohoo!)</p>
