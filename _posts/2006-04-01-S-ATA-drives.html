				<h1>S-ATA drives</h1>
				<p>So I picked up a 200 gig S-ATA hard drive last night - kind of amusingly, the place where I got it, reminded a lot of me old haunt in Ottawa - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070123204359/http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22Chiang+Computers%22+ottawa">Chiang Computers</a>.  Although I have to say, selling Atari's was a lot easier than building machines these days - if it didn't work, send it back!  And maintenance consisted of dropping a 520ST from 3 inches, or <em>twisting</em> the machine.  (Oh, yes, 'Dunderklumpen!')  Good times, good times.</p>
<p>Anyways, so I plug the drive into the motherboard and then start looking for the power connector.  Check the website, there should be one... This is the older version of the Sonata - and even though the specs say the True Power 380s should have a SATA connector - well, those must be the specs for the TPII 380s.  Losers.  Start thinking about plugging another PS I have in there which DOES have a SATA power connector...  Can't take the old PS out without removing the Zalman heat bloom thing.  I <em>don't</em> want to remove the Zalman, nor the processor.  Take out the DVD drive, feed all the power cables out — Stuck!  </p>

<p>Wait a sec!  You can <em>buy</em> 12V molex to SATA power adapters!  Urge to kill fading, fading...

								<p>Ah... Chiang. I remember renting games from there in 1st and 2nd year. I also ended up on the roof of those buildings after (the last) Panda Bowl at Landsdowne. This makes me old.</p>
<p>I also find the visual of you emulating the 40yov quite entertaining <img src="../gif/icon_smile-47.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"/>

								<p>Ah my sonata case has ‘em ... but my mb does not support SATA drives very well.  If I were to choose to get a SATA drive, I would be forced to upgrade the MB, meaning the need to remove the zalman, move the goodies from old to new, add more drivers, re-install the OS (I've not once completed a successful windows 'fix' operation) and re-resgister and ... well I could go on but it is a very long and dark path. I actually spent an afternoon contemplating this ... shrink wrapped SATA drive in one hand, healthy PC googling MB specs in the other.</p>
<p>Are they really that much faster than IDE?
