				<p>Suh-weet cheap high resolution monitor, but requires a decent video card.  The cheap korean version I bought requires the videocard to do the heavy lifting with respect to driving the screen, thus the cheap price.  When I bought it, the Korean seller tried to verify the card I was using as I assume they've had unhappy customers who didn't RTFM.</p>
<p>I'm running an XFX Radeon HD6870 on top of a Z77 motherboard (but still running sandybridge for now).  My real goal is a hackintosh, but I'm not sure I picked the right mobo.  I also bought a DisplayPort-to-Dual-DVI adapter from Monoprice but haven't actually seen it working yet.  Did not work with this monitor with my 11″ i7 HD3000 MacBook Air, haven't seen the DP-to-Dual-DVI work in barely-viewed Hackintosh-land nor (post this fix) Linux-land.</p>

<p>Basically, manually get the driver, recompile it for the LTS kernel, install and bob's your uncle.  I am running the PB2700 monitor of the isolated DVI port and a 1920×1200 on the DVI port with all the HDMI and DisplayPort noise.  Once the PB2700 monitor works at all with Linux it will then start to show boot screens.</p>
<p>It is teh awesome.</p>
