				<h1>Sky light so bright...</h1>
				<p>Primary mission for the weekend accomplished:  Putting two layers of plastic insulation in the <a href="index4d3f-10.html?s=skylight&amp;submit=Search">skylight</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114236/http://www.deadsquid.com/~longman/gallery/skylight/IMG_1806" class="gallery_link"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114236im_/http://www.deadsquid.com/~longman/gallery/albums/skylight/IMG_1806.thumb.jpg" class="gallery_image" alt="[img]"/></a></p>
<p>Two layers?  Well I'm convinced that, even though we've never really had any seepage from rain, there's a hole in the skylight or the (non-functional) fan at the apex.  By eliminating the convective action with the outside air, I think the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114236/http://www.roofhelp.com/Rvalue.htm">R-value</a> should be improved.</p>
<p>But really I think skylights should be easily sealable at night, by design.  Something along the lines of an insulative material in a frame, on a track, which slides into place with a long rod.  While I might miss seeing moonlight in the winter, the energy savings would more than justify an LED night light. </p>
<p> I also think that skylights should have an external passive summer shield which is designed to block the sun during the summer (i.e. at high angles).  Much better than <a href="img_1804.html">my internal implementation</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, I'm quite happy to say that even though it has dropped to -10&deg;C, we haven't turned on the electric heaters yet.  This is due to two things:  the water radiators have been working almost non-stop so far this year, and the <a href="index78d6-19.html?p=195">big warm blanket</a>. </p>
<p>Finally, you'll <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114236/http://www.roofhelp.com/Rvalue.htm">note</a> that cork has a high R-value.  I was shopping for a large mouse mat to replace the 11″x17″ Discreet mouse mat which I can't find  (I suspect my former sub-letters nicked it).  I was at a local hardware store, and found a roll of cork which is designed to fit on shelves and in drawers to protect glasses and keep items from sliding around overly.<br/>

It's fragile - I ended up taping the borders down to protect the sides rather than keep it in place - but its a brilliant alternative to polyethylene, and probably healthier too, less outgassing.  It's not exactly smooth, but I like it.  It's warm, I don't feel like the desk is sucking my life-force, and my optical meese like it.

								<p>Hmm, I think the problem with night shields or whatever is dealing with the ice etc. in the winter.  Plus the elements are tough with external motor.  Putting it on the inside is harder to fit with the frame and keeping the insulation etc. around there.

								<p>[...] Looking back at Jan-Mar 2006, that's pretty amazing. What it says basically is that we didn't turn the heaters on most of the winter. In addition I'd added a double layer of plastic to the skylight. Which was ugly and noisy but pretty effective. (Ugly because there's a sprinkler system poking up there and noisy because the skylight isn't perfectly sealed (!) the plastic would move alot, eventually ripping, with pressure changes outside.)
