				<h1>cleaning house</h1>
				<p>The good news is that we put some work into cleaning up the house - the bad news is we missed the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114415/http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/04/green_expo_in_p.php">Green expo in Peterborough</a>. (Peterborough!?   Well, I guess it wouldn't be a propos in Toronto.)</p>
<p>I'd set up a Calendar on my mac to let me know about it, but I'm not sure if I had entered this event.  I might have missed it. </p>
<p>(I'll check it later.)
