				<h1>iPod Shuffle reset utility</h1>
				<p>Good news!  I've had a brain-dead 1st gen iPod Shuffle for the last 9 or so months.  The last time it worked, I was in Alabama!  It could have been the sub-zero night that did it in, although I do remember it playing between 4am and 6am since it was too cold to sleep that night.</p>
<p>The symptoms were basically that it was unaddressable as a flash drive on a Mac nor a PC and the lights would flash green/orange.  I'd scanned the forums and the collective response at the time was, send it back to Apple at half the cost of a new one (now even more than the cost of a <a title="will this work?" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808085507/http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/canadastore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=199E1BD&amp;nclm=CertifiedMac">refurbished</a> one).  I was disappointed at the time but I also thought if the battery would ever completely drain then maybe it would reset.  So I'd pick it up again every week or so and get the lights to flash.<br/>
Today I was scanning the Apple website for fun stuff and found the <a title="the support document" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808085507/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303979">iPod Shuffle reset utility</a>. Sure enough, download it, install it, run it, *bang* got my iPod shuffle back.<br/>
Which is nice, as I have a second-gen iPod Shuffle (which is nice <img src="../gif/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"/> ) but it isn't as versatile since it requires a dock.  So I consider them two different tools in the tool belt:  the first-gen is data-oriented and the second-gen is portability oriented.
