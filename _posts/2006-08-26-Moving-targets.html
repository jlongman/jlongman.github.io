				<h1>Moving targets</h1>
					<p>After upgrading to Knoppmyth R5C7 we suddenly became aware of server load.  A 'Reschedule', which basically happens any time you touch the schedules or complete a recording, would cause stuttering in the front end.  Myth is a complicated enough system it could be any number of things.</p>
	<p>One plan of attack though was to look at /proc/interrupts, and lo and behold â€“ the analog capture card and the digital mpeg encoder card were on the same interrupt.  So I shuffled the cards a bit and bang, now one of the USB devices is on the same interrupt as the software encoder.  Oh well.  Hopefully it'll be better.</p>
	<p>In the meantime I moved some videos and music off one drive onto the other, so I could reformat the other drive with more inodes.  I had messaged the myth-devel list suggesting perhaps their SCM drive was full, as I was given a disk full warning when checking out, despite having gigs of free space.  What a publicly embarassing way to learn out how useless that error message was.</p>
	<p>That is all in preparation for my blinkenlights project.  Seeing as how mythtv release 0.20 should be happening soon, it's a good time to check out the source and make the mods.</p>
