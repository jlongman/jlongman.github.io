<blockquote><p> Marketing director: When they see 'build 448â€³, they will think that it took over *four hundred* builds to get right  (sic)</p></blockquote>
<p>We use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195745/http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">continuous integration</a> to help detect problems caused by limitations in most source code control tools.   We've topped 1000 builds for one point release in the past though.  Our Official Builds are around a centennial for this point release (don't ask).</p>
<p>I suspect this conversation happened at Microsoft when Windows 2000 went away and XP appeared. <img src="../gif/icon_wink-26.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley"/>

								<p>That's 'product manager' <img src="../gif/icon_smile-24.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"/>  The marketing director only says 'great idea!'. The upsetting thing about that post is the comments, and how far both sides still are at even trying to understand each other.

								<p>It takes us so many builds to get it right, we have to use letters (prod000bk97).
