				<h1>Mac Pro Air?</h1>
				<p>What is the thinnest OSX desktop out there?  The AppleTV.  Similarly, the worst performing.  But!  It works... Not that I've tried to do much beyond boot and look at the System Info, but the mouse works, the keyboard doesn't and the wireless does.</p>
<p>I followed <a title="semthex's kernel" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080605001325/http://www.hackint0sh.org/forum/showthread.php?t=634">these</a> instructions,  and surprisingly it even booted from my hard drive that didn't seem to want to be bootable according to the patchstick and mb_boot_tv methods.  It took hours to complete - I'd imagine an <a title="basically an identical method for PC's but with bios's, IIRC" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080605001325/http://www.osx86project.org/">OSX86project</a>-style stripped installation would be a good idea - but it worked.</p>
<p>A no-install USB boot of OSX on the AppleTV.  Frankly, this doesn't hold MUCH interest to me as the goal is a HD-capable MythTV frontend.  And that is only capable on Linux with the nvidia hardware acceleration working.  But it's good to know that there's another way to back up the AppleTV hard drive without voiding the warranty.</p>
