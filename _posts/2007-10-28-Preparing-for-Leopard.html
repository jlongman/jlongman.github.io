				<h1>Preparing for Leopard</h1>
				<p>I decided to upgrade the hard drive on my MacBook in preparation for Leopard.  Honestly, I don't know what I'll use it all for unless I start using Parallels or VMWare, but it could mean that I could actually store my pictures and videos on my laptop.  There are some climbing clips that are over 7 years old that need editing. (!)</p>
<p>This was partially motivated by the need to make a backup before installing Leopard.  Since I needed to make a backup, and one of the things I like about my MacBook is you can boot from your backups BEFORE you need them, I picked up a Western Digital Passport USB drive from Costco for ~$<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071121044728/http://www.costco.ca/Browse/Product.aspx?Prodid=10305025&amp;Sp=C&amp;Nr=P_CatalogName:BCCA&amp;N=4008634&amp;No=8&amp;Ne=4000000&amp;cat=4298&amp;Mo=15">150</a> (thanks, <a title="WARNING! redflagdeals can be very addictive" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071121044728/http://www.redflagdeals.com/forums/showthread.php?t=491932">rfd</a>!).  A quick look shows a similar price being listed on TechBargains.com - so that might even be a decent price comparing to buying from the US.</p>
<p>The beauty of this USB drive, besides just the cost-per-gigabyte, is that it's a SATA drive which is compatible with my MacBook.  Plonk it out (rip it out - there are tons of little fasteners), separate it from the USB2-&gt;SATA connector, and then it's time to open the Mac:</p>
<p>At the same time as all this I'm also swapping a motherboard on my MythTV frontend - long story short it lost its USB ports thanks to static discharge.  Except I forgot to pick up some thermal paste as I was hoping to pop out and pop in the CPU and heatsink as one unit (you could do this a couple of CPUs I've had - it's not recommended tho).  So then I was booting an old G4 Mini so that Joan could use MythTV while I was bidouilling... (er, to hack is bidouiller, now you know).   So there's a lot going on, partially in prepartion for my leaving for Spain.</p>
<p>I also needed the Mini to look up the instructions on popping out a MacBook hard drive.  Ends up it's not too bad - you remove the battery and the memory cover, and then the hard drive is basically the remaining width of the laptop from the battery.  Pull out the white tab and the hard drive comes out smoothly.  Only to discover it had a nice little rack which had the pull-tab attached to it which required a torx screwdriver.  I'm pretty sure that wasn't mentioned in the PDF I scanned quickly.</p>
<p>Rob has some torx grommets he thought might be the right size based on the rough measurements I gave him, and he also had some spare thermal paste for my CPU/heatsink so I went over to check out the remainder of his costume, his new computer/mythfrontend, and his close-enough-sized torx bits.  Oh, I also showed him how to get at some of the new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071121044728/http://compiz.org/">Compiz</a> effects in the most recent version of <a title="i'm curious to read the origin of the name" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071121044728/https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GutsyGibbon">Ubuntu</a>, which we'd been goofing around with at work on Friday. (Canonical Ltd, the makers of Ubuntu, are actually in our building although I've not been to see their offices)</p>
<p>Get home (it's freezing!  my clutch foot was shivering so badly I thought I'd do some serious damage) and chat with Joan a bit as she's just gone to bed and then back to the laptop.  I'd like to have it in working order and ready to go so I could decide whether to do Leopard or not, and also be secure about a backup.</p>
<p>Anywho, I stick the hard drive in the laptop - being careful to press against the right places on the laptop (not the lid!).  It slides in to what feels like the right distance but then I couldn't close the memory cover.  It was about a millimeter off. I thought at first it was a different sized drive, which happened a lot with older laptop drives, and even just peeled off the rubber part on the back off the memory cover, but when I closed it up, no drive.</p>
<p>Okay...  Boot with the USB on the original drive - works.  (Phew! It's not something really fundamental).  Remove the new drive and boot with the USB on the new drive - works.  (Phew! Didn't kill the drive!)  Long story short, I looked inside the hard drive slot and there was something in there!  I was expecting a pristine slot.</p>
<p>One of the rubber guide rails on the side of the drive had come off - and was blocking the connection from happening.  I couldn't really feel this while inserting as it is a really tight fit - almost connection friction the entire length.  Amazingly, I'd tried flipping the drive earlier and the resistance was very different - must have just been some weird luck as it ends up most of the time I was inserting the drive upside-down. (hint:  look inside and count the number of pins - match them up.  Also, the shiny side is up towards you as you are inserting, not the drive label).</p>
<p>I placed the top of the guide correctly and then gave a half-effort to push it in place the rest - it wasn't really necessary as inserting the drive with the correct orientation went smoothly.  It's likely that inserting it inverted exacerbated or even caused the issue as there were rails on the rubber guide.  I then replaced the rubber I'd removed from the memory cover and I guess I was subconsciously so sure it would work I put everything back together without testing first.</p>
<p>Power it up and... the Folder with a Question Mark!  Damn!  Oh wait, there's the Apple!  And here I am!</p>
<p>Big HD:<br/>
Capacity:    232.76 GB</p>
<p>I also re-assembled the old drive and it mounts.  Tomorrow I'll maybe go climbing and if there's time finish the CPU/mobo and also ensure that I can boot from the old drive.  I suspect I'll be installing Leopard at work tomorrow, too.

								<p>[...] Apparently I was using Apple Partitioning on the new drive and Intel Macs and Leopard require 'GUID Partition Tables' or some such non-sense.  As I'd backed up in the last posting, I wasn't too worried about that, save for the time it would take. It's not easy to find the partition options in Disk Utility either, the option is buried in menus and combo-boxes.  I erased the drive a couple of times before I found the right option. Here is more information than I got during the Leopard install that may help you. [...]
