				<h1>Grades</h1>
					<p>I remember when Fred Rouhling claimed 9b French route grade, 5.15b in the <acronym title="Yosemite Decimal System">YDS</acronym>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061019122754/http://climbing.com/print/features/fredrouhling/">This</a> article is an interesting reflection on grades and the distractions of life from climbing.</p>
	<p>Aw crap, wordpress ate my entry.  Screw it, I'll leave this part in.  It was good though. <img src="../gif/icon_sad-7.gif" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley"/> </p>

								<p>Thats a cool article.</p>
<p>I guess at that level there is all too much attention paid to people and grades.  It's a fine line up there...</p>

								<p>Yeah, Leanna and I went down on our last weekend together.</p>
<p>Girls Of Cheektowaga is the new V7 I got.</p>
<p>I think you've tried it â€“ It's at the back of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061019122754/http://www.glenbouldering.com/guide-spec.php3?3" rel="nofollow">balancing boulder in Oz</a>.</p>
<p>I had worked it one other time while I was down there.  I got it on my 4/5th try on friday.  Leanna had some key beta for me and I couldn't have done it without her.</p>
<p>I also tried Big Mac Deal wis Beer V8 a handful of times and I think that I can get that one.  It has 3 moves under a horizontal roof and then you have to do a heel-hook while you are upside down as you are coming out of the roof.  I like the style.</p>
<p>There is also 2 good V7 problems in Bizarro.</p>
<p>Nogoko V7 is amazing but I'd need a few more pads to get at it seriously, and Bonfire Rodeo V7 seems doable but I think I'd wanna work it with you J cause I think you'd have some good beta for it.</p>

								<p>Another cool thing to remember about grades:</p>
<p>'What we have to understand is that grades are, will always be, and must be, very subjective. If a route is correctly graded 9a that means there will, and should be, climbers who considers it both 8c+ and 9a+, because; hey, people are different! ' </p>
