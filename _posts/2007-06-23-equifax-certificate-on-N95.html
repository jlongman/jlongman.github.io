				<h1>equifax certificate on N95</h1>
				<p>I wanted my N95 to check my email automagically but, as I noted <a href="index4bd3-5.html?p=326">before</a>, there was a certificate issue.  Namely it considered deadsquid's certificate untrusted.  It looks like the N95 had a certificate for Equifax, but not the root that Kev used for deadsquid's mail.  By examining the certificate I could see which one it was, and then I eventually found the matching certificate <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808084747/http://www.geotrust.com/resources/root_certificates/index.asp">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can see the certs currently on your N95 by going Menu-&gt; Tools -&gt; Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Security -&gt; Certificate Management.  They're listed there.  The cert I had was the Equifax Secure Certificate Authority, the cert I needed was something along the lines of ... Global eBusiness.</p>
<p>At first I tried downloading it using the built-in web client, but there's no way to save an actual page to disk, from what I can see.  I then actually downloaded the <a title="beta of 4, at this time" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808084747/http://www.operamini.com/beta/">Opera Mini beta</a> but — although it looks nice, fast and well-designed — it doesn't permit saving either.  Finally I just downloaded the .cer version to my Mac, then hit Command-Shift-B in the Finder and bluetooth'd it to my phone.  The N95 immediately recognized as a certificate and allowed me to install it.</p>
<p>It did  reboot without warning when next I tried entering the deadsquid mail folder, but appears to be working now.  Meaning no more untrusted certificate prompts when accessing deadsquid mail.  Sweet.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a title="romanian?" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808084747/http://blog.unsecured.ro/2006/05/untrusted-certificate-gmail-on-nokias.html">this</a> blog for the pointers to the fact that this could be done, even though the certs listed weren't what I needed.
