				<h1>Knoppmyth R5.5 and Mythbuntu 8.04.1 and fail</h1>
				<p>Neither one of these distributions would come up clean, but at least Mythbuntu was giving me enough information to look for things online.  Knoppmyth I was really at a loss!</p>
<p>FINALLY I figured out that lirc was modprobe'ing and using the device from the USB VFD display and IR receiver instead of the IR Blaster on my PVR-150.  In addition in Mythbuntu, networking was coming up before mysql, and this also screwed things up.</p>
<p><code><br/>
sudo rmmod lirc_imon<br/>
sudo /etc/init.d/lirc restart<br/>
sudo /etc/init.d/mysql restart<br/>
sudo /etc/ini.d/mythtv-backend restart<br/>
</code></p>
<p>Will do wonders, assuming you've otherwise setup lirc correctly.</p>
<p>So I need to make things permanent and figure out how to stop the tuner cards from swapping devices on boots, as well as stop crashing every now and then.  I may go back to Knoppmyth just because I'm more familiar with where it keeps files.</p>
