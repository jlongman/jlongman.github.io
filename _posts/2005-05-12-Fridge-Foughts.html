				<h1>Fridge Foughts</h1>
				<p>Well, about two weeks ago the latch on our fridge, a fish-clad Kelvinator, broke.  Since then we've been wedging it shut with a pole and a weight on top (specifically, my climbing pad).  We'd already been thinking about replacing it, but there was no urgency until the door broke.  </p>
<p>See, the thing is we live on the top floor of a 3 story apartment.  But since the ceilings are 12â€³ in height, it's more like being on the top floor of a 5 or 6 story apartment.  And there is an elevator, but it opens into the neighbors apartment and the locked basement, and it's quite possibly a hundred years old.  It's definitely not safe to ride in.  (It's open, as in you can see the walls go by, too).</p>
<p>And we don't know how long we're going to stay here, but it's less than 2 years, so we'd have to pick up all the kit and kaboodle and move it, maybe damage it, etc..  Which doesn't really appeal to me.</p>
<p>So my thought, is get a cheap and not energy-inefficient fridge (E.g. a $400 12 cubic foot Danby (like this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195236/http://danby.ca/en/productDetails.asp?model_no=DFF1170W&amp;dept=0008">one</a> from Costco, which does 420kWh/year) and plan on selling it cheap when we leave it.  My other crazy thought is to go nuts for the most energy efficient - viz., a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195236/http://sunfrost.com/refrigerator_models.html">Sun Frost</a> which uses about 200kWh/year and is supposed to be 'better' at keeping food. And it can be purchased to run on DC, which is good for alternative, off-grid, energy sources.  And it costs ~$3600. </p>
<p>Or somewhere in the middle.  Which I think is more what Joan wants.  And soon!</p>
<p>Anyways.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195236/http://www.sunfrost.com/">Sun Frost</a> is a very <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195236/http://sunfrost.com/concepts_sustainable.html">interesting</a> company, and they finally answered the question Canadians have been asking forever:  How do we use the power of the Canadian winter to refridgerate our food? </p>
