				<h1>Hybrid Vehickles Rock</h1>
				<p>My parents picked up 2 Honda Civic Hybrids, and then got rid of one of the Civics to get the 2005 Honda Accord Hybrid.  (As a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231141/http://www.desert-estates.info/">real-estate agent</a> in a place where the temperature gets insanely hot, you MUST be able to air condition the back seat!) </p>
<p>I have to say, I'm pretty freaking impressed.   I don't understand why every vehicle wouldn't have the recuperative braking, or an instantaneous energy usage meter to help you control your driving patterns.  And shutting off the engine when you're not moving is brilliant.   More later, if I ever have time... <img src="../gif/icon_wink-35.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley"/>
