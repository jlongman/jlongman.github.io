				<h1>hudsonTracker on OSX 10.5.7</h1>
				<p>When faced with a Java app that won't start like this:<br/>
<code><br/>

<p>The solution is to copy the /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Resources/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub over the existing Foo.app/Contents/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub.  A more explicit explanation is that the JavaApplicationStub you are copying over does not have the required architecture and the .app is not exposing it so you can set the 32-bit flag (I suspect).  If you do 'file Foo.app/Contents/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub' and compare that with 'file /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Resources/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub', you should see the difference.</p>
<p>I don't know, could be bat guano for all I have time to care.  This makes it work.</p>

								<p>Cool I was wondering what was going on - Mac must have updated the JavaApplicationStub in an update, which caused a whole bunch of Java apps to break &gt;: |</p>
<p>Anyway my latest hudsonTracker release (1.6) seems to be working for now at least.</p>

								<p>Thanks for the app btw.   I've been trying to think about how to fit hT with Prowl but the failures on our hudson right now are a little noisy thanks to false-negatives caused by server failures.</p>
<p>later, j</p>
