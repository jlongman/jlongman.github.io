				<h1>A note on frustration</h1>
				<p>Argh, I'm trying to build some iPhone apps, and it looks like building on Leopard is a difficult nut to crack - I think right now the problem is the headers I have aren't correct.  Bugger!  STUPID headers.  There's some tomfoolery in getting the tools to work, and that may be the real problem.  Argh!</p>
