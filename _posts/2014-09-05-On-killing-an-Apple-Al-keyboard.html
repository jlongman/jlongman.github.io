				<h1>On killing an Apple Al keyboard</h1>
				<p>I'd been a wanderer for a while, which meant I ended up putting my Apple Al keyboard into storage.  Inevitably, the batteries corroded. I managed to get one out by using hot water on the case (go Al), but the other two were stubborn.  It's a model A1255, if you're curious.  </p>
<p>Cue tech reading which leads to heat, coffee (alkaline), CLR (why not), hammer, vibrations, blunt force screwdriver, scraping, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160509233117/https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Apple+Wireless+Keyboard+(A1255)+Teardown/5239" title="Step 8 is bullshit, doesn't work">disassembly</a> and my critical mistake: disassembly <em>WITH</em> hammer.</p>
<p>That's a mistake because the the structure is no longer intact and the ring around the power button bent.  On bending it back, it snapped.  Crap.  Still, all is not lost, duct tape after all, if I could just get the damn corroded batteries out.  Oh snap.  There goes the wire to the power button.</p>
<p>Still I can solder that.  But not today, I'm home sick from work and enough frustration.  I'll just tape the screws to the keyboard and put it aside...  Ah.  The screws are stuck to the screwdriver's magnet inside the screwdriver, which of course is where I put them to keep from losing them.  Ha.  Ha.  Ha.</p>
<p>I'm SO done with this.</p>
<p>(Note, I'll maybe attach a note to the keyboard saying where to get the screws and then try a bigger magnet.  Or opposite magnet.)  (Or I'll swallow a fly!)</p>
