				<h1>On days of the week</h1>
				<p>A Greek co-worker was telling me how the names of the week in Greek corresponded to the numerical order of the day in the week, rather than obscure references to Norse gods.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sunday is onesday,<br/>
Monday is twosday,<br/>
Tuesday is threesday,<br/>
Wednesday is foursday,<br/>
Thursday is fivesday,<br/>
Friday is sixday,<br/>
Saturday is sevensday.</p></blockquote>
<p>Saying this aloud amuses me.  A lot.</p>
