				<h1>Grades mean nothink!</h1>
					<p>But according to 8a.nu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061019190717/http://www.8a.nu/cgi-bin/scorecard/show.cgi?view=13616&amp;page=5">I'm</a> ranked 32nd (of 76! ha!) in Canada for bouldering over the last year, and 108 in Canada, historically... for people who have bothered to use their database.</p>
	<p>Don't you love qualifiers?  'Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics...'  Still,  Woohoo!</p>
	<p>Of course, I'd drop 4 or 5 places, like that!, if you guys entered your grades. <img src="../gif/icon_smile-14.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"/> </p>
