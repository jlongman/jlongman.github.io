					<p>Crap!  Crap! Double Crap!</p>
	<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044805/http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> is irrelevant for any kind of 'news for nerds' that is timely.  Case in point, a huge <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044805/http://science.msfc.nasa.gov/ssl/pad/solar/cmes.htm">Coronal Mass Ejection</a> (Good news, everyone lived!  Well, except those that died) that hit the earth this weekend, resulting in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044805/http://www.spaceweather.com/aurora/gallery_01may05_page2.htm">incredible</a> aurorae borealis... and I don't find out about it until this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044805/http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/16/0529217&amp;tid=160&amp;tid=1">morning</a>.  </p>
	<p>I think I'm going to pay attention to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044805/http://www.spaceweather.com/">SpaceWeather</a> now, although the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044805/http://spaceweatherphone.com/">SpaceWeatherPhone</a> at min $US5/month, seems a bit excessive.  There must be a free service that emails/sends SMS messages.</p>
