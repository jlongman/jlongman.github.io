				<h1>on password security</h1>
				<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212194239/http://www.hydroquebec.com/residential/index.html">Hydro</a> has a <a href="indexa36b-65.html?p=148">wonderful</a> client webpage that allows you to do all kinds of great things like look at your consumption.   Unfortunately, they require a password with a number, unlike any of my other utilities.  I generally do use different passwords with my utilities but I mix usernames and passwords up a lot between them, so typically it takes a while to get the right username and password combination.</p>
<p>Except they lock the account for 24 hours after 3 tries.  Which can be really frustrating, as chances are I won't hit the right combination in less than 3 tries.  </p>
<p>And what are they protecting?  The ability to see your consumption, the ability to submit your meter reading and the ability to pay your bill.  Possibly, *possibly*, you can cancel your account.  (Actually, I'm not going to test that just as fodder for this blog.)  Frankly, if someone wants to break into my account and pay my bill... the password is:  <img src="../gif/icon_wink-44.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley"/> </p>
<p>So what is the 'correct' workaround?  (Er, correct for me)   â€” click the 'forgot password' link, fill in the answer to the security question (which has no number nor length restrictions), wait for the email, paste it into the form, and reset the password to something else you will forget in the 30 to 60 days before you check it again.  It's easier to do that than risk the account getting locked.
