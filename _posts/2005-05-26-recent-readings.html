<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044912/http://www.boingboing.net/2005/05/24/crazy_lenticular_mam.html">Crazy Lenticular!</a> â€“ You have to wonder whether the presence of these clouds means something bibical is happening, (you know, in the biblical sense).  Josh once told me that when he first arrived in Canada he would spend his days just looking at the clouds, maybe in kiwi-land the clouds are always lenticular mammatus?
</li><li>This seems relevant to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044912/http://shesa.maniac.ca/index.php?p=67">few</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044912/http://charlie.younghusband.org/">people</a> I know, <ol><li>a little <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044912/http://money.cnn.com/2005/04/07/pf/getrich5_0505/index.htm">insight</a> into small business ownership, and </li><li>a site for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044912/http://www.smallbizgeeks.com/">small biz geeks</a>.</li></ol>
</li><li>Speaking of Charlie, his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044912/http://charlie.younghusband.org/cottage/cottageparty2005.php">cottage party</a> is coming up, which traditionally includes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044912/http://www.xinventions.com/webring.htm">potato cannons</a>, but I'd like to see if I can play with a <ol><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044912/http://solarcooking.org/">solar oven</a>, coffee anyone? and</li><li>maybe something from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044912/http://www.howtoons.org/">here</a>:  like a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044912/http://howtoons.net/archives/final/800sodarocket.html">soda bottle rocker launcher</a>.
</li></ol> I can't think of a more fun place to play with things that can burn you and smack you in the face and take out an eye, besides a cottage which is 45 minutes away from anything, and everyone is pleasantly drunk. (uh, seriously!)
</li>
<li>Finally an eco-link, after visiting <a href="bermuda04.html">Bermuda</a> where rainwater is the principal freshwater source, and thinking about eco-living, I've been interested in rainwater.  Treehugger had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044912/http://www.treehugger.com/files/2005/05/seattle_man_ins.php">story</a> about someone using rainwater, which linked to a PDF from the state of Texas about using rainwater.  (It's in the article).  There's a lot of information about precautions required for using rainwater as potable water.  Interesting!</li></ul>
