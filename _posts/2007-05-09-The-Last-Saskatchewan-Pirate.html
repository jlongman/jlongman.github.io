				<h1>The Last Saskatchewan Pirate</h1>
				<p>A friend of mine crowed that finally, 'Canadians are embracing the will of the FSM, and taking up Piracy!'</p>
<p>Cineplex's representative (Jacob) was <a title="canada.com article" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114124/http://www.canada.com/topics/technology/story.html?id=f8ae08f5-b82d-4e87-97b9-67ff7097638f&amp;k=65095">saying</a> on Canada.com:</p>
<blockquote><p>'I don't want to make it an uncomfortable environment to go to the movies,' said Jacob. 'At the end of the day, we don't want to turn these places into airport check-ins.'</p>
<p>Changes to laws in the United States have seen movie piracy in that country plummet.</p>
<p>According to Jacob, one man caught with a camcorder in a theatre was jailed eight years and fined $250,000.</p>
<p>'We need some tougher laws to deal with this situation,' he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Do it.  I dare you.  I double-dog dare you.  Drive people out of the theatre.</p>
<p>Not to mention the obscenity of the disparity between the terms (8 years! wtf!?) of the piracy conviction versus that of, oh-I-don't-know, real <a title="6 years." href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114124/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/12/15/20051215-drunkdriving.html">crimes</a>?</p>

								<p>What I meant was closer to: theatres exist at the sufferance of the consumers.  Take away the movie experience and there will be no one going to the theatres.</p>
<p>If you think people are not going (will not go) to theatres because they can see a crappy screener-cam copy, then you don't understand why people go to the cinema.  You're not going to the theatre to see the movie.  </p>
<p>If you're going to the cinema you're going because you want to experience a movie in the company of other people and sometimes, sometimes they have a better cinema to see it in.  Usually it's too loud too cold and you'd be better off at home.</p>
<p>Oh and within <em>3 months</em> you can rent it.</p>
<p>It's time the cinemas gave us reason to go, rather than to stay at home with our extended editions.
