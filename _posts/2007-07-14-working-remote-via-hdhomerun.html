				<h1>working remote via hdhomerun</h1>
				<p>Heh, I had an inspiration this morning:  what if I can get the IR receiver on my HDHomeRun to act as the controller for my MythTV frontend, and bypass the fact that the USB ports on the mobo are dead?</p>
<p>The instructions are <a title="Look for LIRC, near the bottom" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808084621/http://www.silicondust.com/wiki/hdhomerun/instructions/mythtv">here</a>.  But I didn't know what remote to use.  Then I saw the <a title="It's so cute!" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808084621/http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?mco=BB5E48CD&amp;nplm=MA128G/A">Apple Remote</a> that came with my macbook sitting on the shelf.  I tried a couple of LazyNet configuration <a title="these didn't work for me" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808084621/http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/apple">files</a> but they didn't work - even the one that is apparently the identical model.</p>
<p>So fire up irrecord a couple of times, read the instructions the last time, and bang, it starts to narrow down which remote I'm using.  Cool!</p>
<p>The config file I generated seems more verbose than the ones I saw provided by LIRC, but there's probably a reduction phase I'm not going to bother with.</p>
<p>Course, now that I know how easy it is, I should be able to use the programmable remote that has more than 6 buttons.</p>
<p>Now I just need to link LIRC up with MythTV via the lircrc file...
