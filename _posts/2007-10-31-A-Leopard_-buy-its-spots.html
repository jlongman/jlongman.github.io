				<h1>A Leopard, buy its spots</h1>
				<p>I'm off to Spain in a couple of days for 6 weeks, but I broke down to take some time to put Leopard on the laptop.  Actually it installed while I was off at the gym getting some climbing in - who knows when I will get to exercise next?  Sleep when you're dead, etc.</p>
<p>Apparently I was using Apple Partitioning on the <a title="who knew?" href="index17f1-10.html?p=346">new drive</a> and Intel Macs and Leopard require 'GUID Partition Tables' or some such non-sense.  As I'd backed up in the last posting, I wasn't too worried about that, save for the time it would take.<br/>
It's not easy to find the partition options in Disk Utility either, the option is buried in menus and combo-boxes.  I erased the drive a couple of times before I found the right option. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071121044733/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303609">Here</a> is more information than I got during the Leopard install that may help you.</p>
<p>When that was done I used what is basically the Migration Assistant to move the interesting parts from the backup onto my current drive.  I guess I should check whether my work related materials made it - I doubt it.  Oh, I also had to update AddressBook and a few other things.</p>
<p>I wonder if I hadn't updated AddressBook if I would have <a title="Took the words out of my mouth." href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071121044733/http://forums.appleinsider.com/showpost.php?s=d5f05d05f9ce66492b879271c541e1db&amp;p=1165726&amp;postcount=2">kept</a> the bluetooth callerId functionality?   (A downgrade indeed)</p>
<p>My good will towards Apple is ebbing a bit - between the the Java <a title="Really...?" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071121044733/http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t102936.html">treatment</a> in Leopard - yes Java 5 on Leopard is not only not Java 6, but worse than Java 5 on Tiger - and the iPhone's difficulty in syncing music to more than one machine, being usable as a memory stick, the ringtone debacle, the contracts, DRM, etc... I guess it just means the honeymoon's over.  It's still a better platform than Windows, but something sinister may lurk behind the curtain, and maybe that thing is success.</p>
<p>(Not that I don't understand why Apple would be bitter about Sun paying for Windows Java and not OSX Java - and not that I don't think that some of the Leopard features for Cocoa (on <a title="Oh the poor bastards!" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071121044733/http://www.google.ca/search?q=Safari+Windows+Cocoa">Windows</a>?) and Objective-C aren't cool... )
