				<h1>Substitute Drive</h1>
				<p>I'm rushing around to get a few things done before leaving, but I glanced at the <a title="also the difference between BEV and BEA (8mb and 2mb)" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071121044738/http://wdc.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wdc.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1410&amp;p_created=1138291119">specs</a> of the drive I installed in my MacBook and noticed something called Reduced-Power-Spinup was enabled by a jumper when I opened the portable case, but I took off the jumper while debugging the issue with the drive.</p>
<p>It ends up that the jumper is enabled for portable USB drives - basically it reduces the power profile for spin-up times so that you don't need a funky medusa-like USB cable or a separate power adapter.  My first thought was that I would want RPS for better battery life but that is not how this <a title="PDF!" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071121044738/http://www.wdc.com/en/library/portable/2579-001116.pdf">PDF</a> describes it.  In any case if you read it you can decide.</p>
<p>The specs also show how you can turn on Spread-Spectrum-Clocking, which allows you to reduce interference caused by your drive.  Now if only there was a jumper for GSM command channels...
