				<h1>More Dream Houses...</h1>
				<p>I spent the second half of the day going through every page of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231420/http://www.glenhunter.ca/archives.html">The Straw House Blog</a>, quite interesting as I've never been involved in building a house before, much less an energy friendly one.  It's quite apparent I've got a lot to learn before I'm ready to do that.  Which is cool.</p>
<p>Serendipitously, the 4 hours of reading also suggested the right words to use to search for a source which I'd been inspired by a long time ago, also, which is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231420/http://enertia.com/science.htm">shell</a> house concept.</p>
<p>I wonder if that technique could be used to overcome the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231420/http://www.glenhunter.ca/archives/000200.html#000200">problems</a> that Glen has experienced.

								<p>For the past few years, Kris and I have been toying with the idea of buying some land in Gatineau to build our next house using straw bale tech. Not sure if we're quite ready to go off the grid, but reading about Glen's efforts has certainly renewed our interest.
