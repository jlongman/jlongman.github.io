				<h1>On reparenting in Hibernate</h1>
				<p>Back to work!</p>
<p>One of the dangling bits of work from 2006 was a problem involving reparenting an object in an object tree without losing child elements.  We're using Hibernate to map our objects into the DB and the parent-child relationship is held in an association.  When I removed a node from one parent and re-added it to another via a oldParent.remove() and newParent.add(), but which should mean DB-wise changing a field in the association, it would happily delete all the child elements of the node I was trying to move!  Inconvenient, since the semantics of what I wanted was to allow something referencing the association to out-live the original association and still retain the child data.</p>
<p>It ends up that you <a title="explanation" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114730/http://forum.hibernate.org/viewtopic.php?p=2313839#2313839"><strong>can</strong></a> do what I want, but you can't use the delete-orphan cascade rule on the association.  Basically, reparenting requires that members relate as Entities but the delete-orphan cascade rule makes them treated as them as Value objects.  Interesting.  So if I want this to work I'll need to manage the members of the deletion of the relationship explicitly if I want to delete rather than reparent.<br/>
Generally I find the Hibernate online documentation written as if someone was planning on making money from writing a book. <img src="../gif/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley"/>

								<p>After a year and a half working with Hibernate I can only give one opinion of it... it tires me.</p>
<p>But now I'm Mr Rails and ActiveRecord so a new word has entered my vocabulary. A word that will never be atrributed to Hibernate... fun!
