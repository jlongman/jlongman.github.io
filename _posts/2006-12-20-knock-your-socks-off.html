<p>Check it out.  Now.  Not only an excellent piece of fiction, but code geekery in the higher order.</p>
<p>Interestingly at work I've been wrestling with JavaScript's lack of type-safety net in the IDE and wanting to temporarily add and remove that safety net.   I'm definitely not pushing its capabilities, just doing a boring selection model.  IntelliJ will let me play with the safety parameters by jiggling the JavaScript inspection profiles (turning up and down the level of warnings) so I'll have to work with that until I really grok JS.
