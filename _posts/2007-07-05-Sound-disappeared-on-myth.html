				<h1>Sound disappeared on myth</h1>
				<p>I dunno why, but my crappiest tuner, the analog one, stopped recording audio.  I'd upgraded the frontend to R5F1 but not the backend, all I'd done was move it so that it was no longer located in the front room, in the hope that I could take down the ladder which goes up to the HDTV antenna.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a title="v4l2-ctl, on my system" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070808084719/http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Terratec_Cinergy_400#You_can_hear_no_sound">this</a> everything is swimmy with the sound again.Â  The ladder is still there.<br/>
Except for an electric shock which burned out the USB ports on my front-end, which REALLY sucks as that's the new Athlon X2 6400 mobo.  A new mobo is about $99 but... labour!  In the meantime, no remotes and no wireless keyboard, but a wired PS2 keyboard works, and so does the webpage which allows you to control most of the frontend.</p>
<p>That really sucks also as my backend is going nuts too.  If I reboot I have to pull the power connector on it or it won't boot up, some kind of bios weirdness or something.
