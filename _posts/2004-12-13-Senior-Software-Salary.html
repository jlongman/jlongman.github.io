				<h1>Senior Software Salary</h1>
					<p>I was reading one of the Metro rags this morning, and came across a story stating that a senior software engineer, which I hope to be soon, is making an average of $CDN100K.  Here's the original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060928185551/http://www.mercerhr.com/pressrelease/details.jhtml/dynamic/idContent/1164920">reference</a>,  which does add a bit of context.  Given that I read it originally in French, I thought maybe that was the Montreal rates â€“ but if you take into account Toronto and Ottawa adding to that rate, and their associated cost of living, it makes a bit more sense.  Still, I'm not making close to that.</p>
