<p>I hadn't checked my Hydro consumption for a while - basically someone stole kev's pint.ca domain and as that was my contact account I no longer was reminded whether I owed money.  I'd even thrown money at them as I didn't know what the amount was, and today I found out they still owe me.  ($3.52, I think).</p>
<p>Looking back at the <a title="Ah sweet memories of June!" href="indexa36b-34.html?p=148">last time</a> I did a power consumption review: it's a vast improvement from early 2004 but we've slipped during the summer of 2005.  There are probably a couple of factors here: using more fans (during the summer) and using MythTV, I imagine since the machine is always on.  We've also gotten more comfortable with the convection oven for cooking and other cooking appliances.</p>
<p>Looking back at Jan-Mar 2006, that's pretty amazing.  What it says basically is that we didn't turn the heaters on most of the winter.  In addition I'd <a title="skylight so bright" href="index5721-31.html?p=201">added</a> a double layer of plastic to the skylight.  Which was ugly and noisy but pretty effective.  (Ugly because there's a sprinkler system poking up there and noisy because the skylight isn't perfectly sealed (!) the plastic would move alot, eventually ripping, with pressure changes outside.)</p>
<p>The last couple of weeks we've had to turn the heat on, as the temperature hovered below -15C for a week or so, and my being at home kind of exacerbates the issue.  We only have one layer of plastic in the skylight but we'd had Joan's brother seal the skylight better and add a couple of bits of wood to make sealing it easier every fall when it gets sealed.</p>
<p>To make things worse I've been trying to  re-align the <a title="this one" href="index8a7d-67.html?p=301">HDTV antenna</a> for a bit, leaving a corner of the plastic unsealed.  In retrospect, having two layers is a really good idea with this skylight.</p>
<p>But I think this will be the last winter in this apartment.  And hopefully whomever moves in here won't go back to heating the neighbourhood.
