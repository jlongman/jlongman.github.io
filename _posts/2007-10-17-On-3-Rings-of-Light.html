				<h1>On 3 Rings of Light</h1>
				<p>So... I picked up a Halo 3 Special Edition while waiting for the 360 coming to back.  I could check out the HDMI port and possibly buy it or, thanks to liberal store policies, return it if HDMI didn't deliver.</p>
<p>Well, thanks to superior industrial design (can you say, 'pants-on-the-head-retarded'?), the only way to get Digital Audio and HDMI (unless your set has a pass-through) is to <a title="JEEBUS!" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080912160911/http://www.chadledford.com/?p=50">break open the existing connector</a> or pay $<a title="wa?" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080912160911/http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?cookie%5Ftest=1&amp;product%5Fid=802758">50</a>.   Of course, the same cable is included with the Elite - which is $50 more.  Microsoft, wtf?</p>
<p>Amazingly, the cable to copy hard drives from the 360's 20 gig drive to the Elite's 120 gig drive is free (well, you have to call).  I wonder if it is free for Premium-&gt;Halo edition?</p>
<p>At this point it looks like I leave for 6 weeks in Spain on November 4th or 5th, so I've got to make a decision sooner than then.</p>
<p>Anyways, so I'm playing Halo 3 again.  And speaking of p-o-t-h-retarded, I turned the 360 while it was spinning hte disk.  It was obvious IMMEDIATELY that was a bad idea.   What was Microsoft thinking?  Apparently the head of the drive sticks out enough to brutalize the surface of your discs.  They'll replace certain discs, including the Halo 3 Limited Edition (mine) for about $24, 2-3 weeks time.</p>
<p>Actually apparently the Limited Edition is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080912160911/http://www.xbox.com/en-US/support/systemuse/xbox360/gameplay/discreplacement-program.htm">known</a> to have scratches from shipping, but mine are fairly ... concentric ... as opposed to the localised scratches of the Limited Edition shipping problem.</p>
<p>I actually tested some of the weirder scratch treatments out there to no good result - but my disc smelled nice and toothpastey/orangey Pledgey.  I even brought it to the local Microplay to test their fancy descratcher.  Tried the game afterwards while at the store but, no joy.  So I rented it for the weekend, since my friend was over to play it with me, and went home to look for the receipt.</p>
<p>Joan had done a good job cleaning, so no joy.  Sigh, bittersweet.</p>
<p>Anywho, I chucked in the bonus disc to see what it had and just for kicks threw in the game disc.  Same green screen on startup, doesn't look good.   Game loads quickly, probably also not good. Wait! It made it past the killer 35%!  Oh my god it worked!</p>
<p>Wait a sec, why am I posting, I could be playing?</p>
