				<h1>I fail to understand diet drinks.</h1>
				<p>I mean, they taste like crap!</p>
<p>I've long been a big fan of diluting fruit juices and pop with water to bring down the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080915211649/http://www.healthbolt.net/2006/12/08/what-happens-to-your-body-if-you-drink-a-coke-right-now/">crazy sweetness</a> but still have some interesting flavour.   I started when I was trying to drop the carbohydrate component of juice while playing volleyball in high school.  I've even drank a lot of sparkling water (until I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080915211649/http://www.drdrew.com/article.asp?id=305">read</a> that it can remove calcium from your body - which is of course true for all carbonated drinks). </p>
<p>Nothing compares to the crappy taste of diet drinks.  They taste like metal.  Yuk.  Oh, not to mention there's nothing to prove that they actually don't cause weight gain, either directly or indirectly since they've been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080915211649/http://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20050613/drink-more-diet-soda-gain-more-weight?page=2">accused</a> of confusing the body that it was supposed to be getting calories, and yet received none.</p>

								<p>hrm. I drink diet drinks pretty much exclusively, but it's really not for the taste. I worked at Coca Cola Bottling when I was in university, and it was there that I saw what happened to high fructose corn syrup after being exposed to air and 100-degree C temps for an hour or so. I haven't been able to drink a sugared beverage since (except for tonic water).</p>
<p>I am a fan of things like Gatorade G2, just wish they'd offer a few more flavours. I miss the citrus. I'll just stick to that, grapefruit juice, and various berry juices with soda (just take your calcium supplements!) <img src="../gif/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"/></p>

								<p>ooo!  What happened!?  I'd love to see that.</p>
<p>I'll drink anything, ‘cept the aspertame acersulfate acersuckass chemicals.  I just dilute it with water, usually max 1/3 alien material, 2/3 tap water.  Even orangina will keep a little pop from the carbonic acid.</p>
<p>G2 I'm really happy to see, although I've not found it as often in Canada as just south of the border.  The amount of sugar in most energy drinks is insane.</p>

								<p>okay, waitaminit. </p>
<p>Sugar and salt are the whole point of gatorade, no?<br/>
the point is to replace lost salt and carb (or make glucose available in the blood) during and after exercise.</p>
<p>Energy drinks, on the other hand, yeah - I'd probably drink a diet red bull. I'm just in it for an 80mg caffeine fix anyway</p>

								<p>Yes, but if you're trying to lose weight the sugar level in Gatorade is high.  The gatorade.ca (it's flash so I can't link in anyways) points out that gatorade is the optimum level of sugar but surely you can get by with less - especially with non-ideal non-athlete diets which are usually high in carbohydrates.  </p>
<p>I also think the gatorade science is based before all the bad side effects of sugar became better known.  Pedialyte (for infants) is used for exercise because of the sugar level of gatorade.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080915211649/http://www.google.ca/search?q=pedialyte+exercise" rel="nofollow">link to the google</a>.  Apparently some people swear by pedialyte as a hangover aid.  (hmmm... too bad pedialyte is expensive.)</p>
<p>The other side effect of sugar is true for both exercise drinks and energy drinks:  the crash.   </p>
<p>I can't believe redbull is a dollar more than most other energy drinks.  I'll drink the quebec alternative (guru) that tastes like flinstones vitamins instead of cough syrup.  (aside redbull qualifies as a flaming moe ingredient in my book).</p>

								<p>(Nutrition nerd time...)</p>
<p>I tend to save gatorade for what it's designed for: during and immediately following exercise. As far as I know, In the former case, making the sugar available quickly in the bloodstream won't be followed by the usual insulin response (see for example <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080915211649/http://www.ultrunr.com/glycemic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultrunr.com/glycemic.html</a>)</p>
<p> 'The concerns about carbohydrate feedings increasing insulin and thus depressing fatty acid availability are obviated when the carbohydrate is fed during exercise because the exercise-induced elevation in epinephrine depresses the release of insulin from the pancreas.'</p>
<p>In the latter case, if your muscle/liver glycogen reserve is depleted, and you are ingesting the carb within a short window after the exercise, it will essentially be stored right back in the muscles and liver via glycogen synthesis, again avoiding the insulin response. (the aforementioned article goes into it also, but there are many other studies as well).</p>
<p>The only real danger, then, sports-wise is consuming a High-GI carb *before* the event, where the resulting 'crash' may make you feel crappy at the start. There doesn't seem to be an effect on performance, though.</p>
<p>Energy drinks, well, again - I drink ‘em for the caffeine - notably, for a *lower* dose than I would get if I grabbed a coffee instead. That, and I drink the cheap stuff: Red Rain. 0.79 a can. Beats the hell out of the $3 red bull.</p>
