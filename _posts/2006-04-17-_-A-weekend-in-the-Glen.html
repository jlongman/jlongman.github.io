				<h1>A weekend in the Glen</h1>
				<p>Another great weekend with the gang - and Joan came too! - off to the Niagara Glen, cramming 9 people into a 1 bedroom condo, and pulling hard on some limestone (and a touch of sandstone).  It was a great time, the weather held together for us and Joan and I had a chance to see John and his new girlfriend Tracey.  Add some gamecube Bongos, downtown Niagara, good food at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195603/http://www.cafetututango.com/">Cafe Tu Tu Tango</a>, some birthday cupcakes and <b>edit: and Easter Eggs!</b> you've got a goodtime.  Awesome.  </p>

<p>The weekend was pretty good climbing-wise:  2 V6's, 'Thunder and Lightning' and 'The Life O'Reilly', and I was close on the V7 <abbr title="Sit Down Start">sds</abbr> of 'Life OReilly' when time ran out.  Definitely the hardest I've ever bouldered, as far as grades.  Except I think those grades are soft - I'm convinced when we were in shape before 'Ye Greate Stoppage Of Climbinge' we could have done them too and I've never sent a V6 before.  I'm not certain the 'V7″ was really a grade harder, or maybe just two more V6 moves, IMHO.   My impressions of the V6's at Hp40 was they were barely attainable, and the V7s I could barely touch.</p>
<p>Bah, I guess its pretty meaningless anyways - with temperature and humidity variations today's V5 can be tomorrow's V10 and vice versa.  I also suspect that as limestone becomes patina'd the grades will move up and as individual climbers get stronger they will downgrade hard climbs.  Eventually everything becomes a V4.</p>
<p>And grades are really just guides to how hard the problems are - stars are what we really should be counting.  How fun or classic or pure a problem is isn't reflected in the grade.

								<p>It was great to see you two too. Too bad I wasn't in better shape to climb. Next time.

								<p>J - I think you are being modest.  You were climbing strong this past weekend.  From what I've seen so far ... and guess it's not a whole lot, the grades were pretty bang on.  I would even say for some of the problems they were a bit stiff ('no u-turn' &amp; ‘hook direct' for example).  </p>
<p>Speaking of classic lines, ‘Life O'Reilly' is a great example of a problem that is solid fun: slightly overhanging, holds that are barely positive enough, moves that are delicate &amp; dynamic, toe hooks for balance, trusting slopey polished jibs to stand on ... and a dyno to a blind positive finishing jug.  Oh yeah it's good.  V-Fun.

								<p>I'm all about the classics.  My climbing goal has always been, and will continue to be, to climb at a level where I can do as many 'classics' as I can.</p>
<p>I am getting closer.  As the grades get harder less people climb at that level; as a result less attempts on fewer problems produce less classics at those grades.</p>
<p>Most of all I like climbs that are naturally geometric with few actual 'holds'.  Climbs like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195603/http://www.pbase.com/gashford/image/50923742" rel="nofollow">The Pondering</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195603/http://daveh.smugmug.com/gallery/1297412/3/61057527" rel="nofollow">Great White</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195603/http://daveh.smugmug.com/gallery/528796/1/21824071" rel="nofollow">Mortal Kombat</a> are wicked examples of straight up geometry.</p>
<p>Another factor is the homogeny.  Climbs like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195603/http://daveh.smugmug.com/gallery/1297412/2/61056637" rel="nofollow"> Orange Crush</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195603/http://daveh.smugmug.com/gallery/1180779/1/55205580" rel="nofollow">Boomerang</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195603/http://daveh.smugmug.com/gallery/528796/1/21825126" rel="nofollow"> The Millipede Boulder</a> are climbs I consider more enjoyable due to the commonality of the movements <abbr title="and">&amp;&amp;</abbr> <abbr title="or">||</abbr> holds it has.

								<p>I seriously can't believe how well we all climbed.  It was pretty insane.  I feel like the grade window of possibilities has moved in a big way instead of in small steps like I'm used to.  I attibute it to patience, confidence and the ability 'work' things...also having role models that can send things and then give good beta helps.  OK, maybe we're getting stronger.  HP was a good mental start for all of us.</p>
<p>J, your double V6 was one of the nicest prizes from the weekend.  Nice to have that in the bag, I bet.</p>
<p>The point about counting stars is a valid one, I think.  The more places I go and the more fun problems I do, the less time I want to spend on chossy awkward crap.  Hopefully there is a lifetime's worth of starred problems in the world.
