				<h1>wii internet</h1>
				<p>cause I'm sure you wanted to know...</p>
<p>Got home to a glowing blink on the Wii, which means an email has been received by the Wii.  Since Wii emails are hard to get to people (since they resemble spam addresses) e.g. w2331213131@wii.com, it was unlikely to be an email, but it was likely to be the trial Wii browser based on <a title="free for desktops, pay for mobile" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070119113604/http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>...</p>
<p>A relatively quick download, with Mario running across the screen (be nice if it was an actual game instead of a proto-game — yes, it was my first download), and I'm browsing!</p>
<p>Wow. Not bad...  The zooming is pretty natural, point and zoom.  It buzzes when you go over a link and clicking worked alright.  The basic interface is there.  It is *usable*.</p>
<p>Couple of points though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be nice if this was a 1080i/p output though, considering my expensive TV can do it and do it well.</li>
<li>Support for what I'm guessing is Flash 8, not Flash 9 - since youtube works, but <a title="funny quebec humour " href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070119113604/http://www.tetesaclaques.tv/">tetesaclaques.tv</a> doesn't work, which is something I noticed on my MythTV linux installation.</li>
<li>Tetes a Claques downloaded slower on my wii than my macbook in a concurrent test.</li>
<li>It kept flashing to other windows and eventually restarted the video on youtube I was checking out, then just closed it (They do warn this is a trial version)</li>
<li>Gmail works, although I just found out some sad news</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>update</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Things I care about:
<ul>
<li>The speed issue with videos is definitely irritating. Are they proxying content!?</li>
<li>I also don't understand why they waste so much onscreen space on buttons.</li>
<li>Why not have tabs?  Especially since it seems to randomly? switch to other screens you've been to before.
<ul>
<li>This begs for an advanced user UI for people who can point at small things, and an easy UI for those suck with the wii-mote.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Watching a video from Youtube,  it apparently blocked for a long time, then the entire video was loaded and finished.  When I tried to play it from the start, it reloaded the page, and thus reloaded the video!!!
<ul>
<li>I'm looking for a decent web video player for when people come over, so this would be nice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zooming and changing font size are two different operations - it would be nice to zoom the font size so that content is readable but contained in well-designed documents.  This eliminates mandatory horizontal scrolling when zooming makes the font readable but the width of the column is beyond the sides of the screen.
<ul>
<li>On a PDA, e.g. in NetFront, this kind of thing is addressed using different modes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There's predictive text in text fields, but not in address fields.  How often do addresses have dictionary-based words in them?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Things not-so-important:
<ul>
<li>There's no URL shown, good luck detecting phishing attacks</li>
<li>The security icon shows you when you're on an SSL-protected website but doesn't offer any more information (64-bit vs 128-bit, see the certificates, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't find those important because I don't think you should be doing anything that requires that level of personal information on your gaming system.  But it would almost be better if it prevented people from accessing those sites, or required explicit agreement from the user.</p>
<p>Still, I I'm looking forward to the full version.

								<p>Call me old-fashioned, but I'm thinking that a desktop with a full web-browser and some sort of 'make it appear on my TV' voodoo might be a better approach; it's not like you lack the hardware <img src="../gif/icon_smile-17.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"/> </p>

								<p>Well, the point and click from the couch thing is nice.  No flat surface required.  I suppose with the wiimote as a HID mouse it would work on a full PC.  Of course, Linux doesn't have Flash 9 either, and windows.... <img src="../gif/icon_razz-4.gif" alt=":-P" class="wp-smiley"/> </p>
<p>Truly an embarassment of riches  — still I think the reason I have it is because nothing does *exactly* what I want from a device.   Which is... well, everything. <img src="../gif/icon_wink-13.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley"/>
