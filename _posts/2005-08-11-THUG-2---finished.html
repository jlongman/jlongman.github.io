				<h1>THUG 2 - finished</h1>
				<p>Finally.  Finished all the Story and Classic modes at all difficulties.</p>
<p>I never did get all the gaps.   I did it really late at night, so I'll have to go back and see if anything cool was opened up.</p>
<p>(I might look online for the 'Butterfinger' in Barcelona.  I see two Butterfinger corporate whoring's - the billboard in the harbour and the machine near the Sants station.  Couldn't get a butterfinger off of either.)
