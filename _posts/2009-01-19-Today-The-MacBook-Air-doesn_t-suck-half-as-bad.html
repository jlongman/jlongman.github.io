				<h1>Today The MacBook Air doesn't suck half as bad</h1>
				<p>I picked up a MacBook Air just before my last work trip to Spain.  Since it took an hour and 45 minutes to get between my hotel in Madrid and my workplace in the suburbs of Toledo — via foot, Metro, Light Rail, and car — I figured the weight difference vs a MacBook (2 pounds plus the weight difference of the p/s) would pay for any hit I would take on purchasing it and reselling it.</p>
<p>Since then I've hung onto it, but considered selling it over and over, something I've never really done with a computer.  Beautiful machine, it's light, bright screen, great keyboard... but the thing was damn slow.  I experienced the CPU dropout watching video and especially with the external monitor attached.  I experimented with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090722002919/http://www.coolbook.se/CoolBook.html">CoolBook</a> to see if it would help (it did, a lot, but then the machine would crash once a week or so - fine for a windows machine but not what I'm used to with OSX).  When an update came out from Apple that was supposed to fix it, I was really happy.</p>
<p>It does fix one of the cores dropping out and the CPU going insane on the remaining core, but Flash was unusable.  Or more specifically videos were unwatchable.  I can't believe that in 2009 watching videos on a 1.6 GHz Core 2 Duo would be so bad.  I was still thinking about selling it (same model refurbished is $<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090722002919/http://store.apple.com/ca/product/FB003LL/A?mco=MjE0NDk5Mw">1099</a>).</p>
<p>Today I installed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090722002919/http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/">Flash 10</a> and then checked out a couple of tough videos.   Here, watch this one, a really interesting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090722002919/http://www.dailymotion.com/remycmoi/video/9421224">bouldering</a> sequence.  This ones really good, bouldering in New York State, it's awesome: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090722002919/http://www.bigupproductions.com/#/vidplayer/Tis_The_Season/">The Season</a>.  A couple of little hiccups, but watchable.</p>
<p>Hmm... +1 climbing fix, maybe this little box can stay.</p>

								<p>My climbing laptop is an Asus S5N:<br/>
Intel Pentium M 1.50GHz<br/>
768 MB Memory<br/>
Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy)<br/>
2.8 lbs and 12.1″ Screen.  Perfect climbing laptop.</p>
<p>I browse using Firefox 3.0.5 and flash video chuggs.  It really pisses me off.  I'm currently taking your advice and I am installing the Flash 10 .deb package.  I'll let you know if it makes any difference.</p>
