				<h1>iTerm like Terminal</h1>
				<p>iTerm is pretty cool, I'll post more about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090722002924/http://kpumuk.info/mac-os-x/how-to-show-ssh-host-name-on-the-iterms-background/">this</a> background hostname trick if I have time to play with Quartz later on.  The killer feature for me was being able to drag tabs between windows.  However, iTerm is still really slow compared to Terminal.  Hopefully it's more stable.</p>
<p>To get the same keys as Terminal to switch tabs (Command-shift-[ and -]) in iTerm:</p>
<p>Command-Alt-B to get the Profiles dialog, Keyboard Profiles, Global.<br/>
Double click the key combination for previous tab: cmd-shift-hex code 7b, with High interception Priority<br/>
Double click the key combination for next tab: cmd-shift-hex code 7d, with High interception Priority</p>
<p>Note that the values are 7b and 7d and are not contiguous. </p>
<p>Command-Shift-square brackets is the same combination used in Firefox, which is why I prefer it.  Adium shares the Command-arrows but in my case that switches windows and I don't use tabs so it doesn't fel natural for me.</p>
