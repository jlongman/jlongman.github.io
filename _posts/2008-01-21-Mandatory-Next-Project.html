				<h1>Mandatory Next Project</h1>
				<p>I swear that I'm not a fanboy - I've hacked my iPhone, and installed (a partially working) iPhone Dev Toolchain on my Macbook.</p>
<p>I picked up an AppleTV, with which I hope to install a linux, HD-decoding capable MythTV on it.  Delicious!</p>
<p>So far I've got the 1.0.9 mb_boot_tv bootstick running.  Fortunately I came across instructions pointing out that the compiled copy available online is garbage.  I also had a backup of my laptop drive from when Tiger was on it.</p>
<p>Ideally, the next step is to build the netboot image to run the Linux Myth frontend with appropriate hacks and driver updates.  I may eventually look at modifying the AppleTV drive, but only after I've confirmed the hardware can hack HD.  And once I know about AppleTV Take 2.</p>
<p>I'll link this entry up later...

								<p>Very interested to know how it goes. Those Apple TV boxes *are* tempting.

								<p>Will it really matter what Take 2 is like? Is there actually a chance there will be a licensing deal for Canada? We don't even have iTunes movies yet. Hell, we only got our 21 TV shows a few months back.</p>
<p>(oh boy. the new episode of little mosque is available)

								<p>Well, the xbox 360 marketplace *finally* got some content, about a buck more per video.  If you ask me, that's still too high - I'm not too lazy to go down six flights of stairs and pay $2...  The purchases at $9.99 and $14.99 are more interesting than a 24-hour rental for $3.99.  But then it depends on the DRM.  Do I *own* it? or not?</p>
<p>as an update as I've been sick at home the last couple of days in between high fevers: it's clear that if I bit the bullet and wrote to the internal disk then I'd be a lot further along.  I do have a bootable 1.0.9 mb_boot_tv disk, which gets to the tftp server and the (questionable choice of linux kernel and ramdisk) but apparently stops there.</p>
<p>(I've not really been finding some good netboot kernels/ramdisks... I should look for some dsl installations or something as I'm afraid it might be the ram issue)</p>
<p>I think the next thing I'll do is look at a patchstick which, instead of installing the updates, backs up and saves the image of the appletv drive.  That's concern numero uno for me right now.  It should be easy except that I can't find my USB hard drive enclosure that takes PATA drives, and all my USB-SATA drive enclosures have content I can't eff with, including my Tiger backup.
