				<h1>sick at home</h1>
				<p>Been sick since tuesday.  Normally a cold lasts a day for me, and I bounce back.  But not this one.  </p>
<p>In the meantime I've <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070122175744/http://www.megagames.com/ps2/ps2_laser_calibration.shtml">re-calibrated my PS2's  laser</a> - ensuring it can run <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070122175744/http://www.rockstargames.com/vicecity/">Vice City</a> - also checked out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070122175744/http://ebgames.com/ebx/product/238164.asp">Game Shark Media Player</a> disk (which is really difficult to run, as it's a PS2 disk on a very thin CD) and Joan's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070122175744/http://www.gamespot.com/ps/action/marvelsuperheroes/">favourite game</a>.</p>
<p>And I've bid on a fair number of electronics on ebay.  I'm wondering if rebuilding hardware for profit would be viable.  I was looking at Treo's and Apple laptops.</p>
<p>Bleah.  Sleep. I've got too much work to do.

								<p>[...] In probably unrelated news, it appears that J has been sick this week as well, and it's been dragging on for him, too. [...]

								<p>I ran the media player for years. Eventually, I gave it up. Just too buggy. </p>
<p>If they had thrown even a modicum of support at it, it could have been a great (albeit niche) product. But they threw none.
