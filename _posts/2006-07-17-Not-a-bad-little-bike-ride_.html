				<h1>Not a bad little bike ride...</h1>
				<p>One of the dangers of bouldering, especially on a wall that isn't very big but is really steep, is that you can really do a lot of anaerobic activity without getting a good balance of aerobic.  This has the disadvantage that, not only do you suck on longer traverses and in routes, but you can get fat. </p>
<p>(Ok, I'm not fat, I know, but 'fatter' - and in any case I see these things as trends rather than absolutes.  It might be nice that you tell me how skinny I am, but that doesn't mean I'm not snowboarding down that slippery slope to an unhealthy state!)</p>
<p>So yesterday I popped on the bike and whipped out a ~40k ride.  Not bad considering it's the second time I've gotten on the bike this year.  And I didn't have any water with me.   Fortunately it was only around 29&deg;C when I was riding, and most of the time it was cloudy.  </p>
<p>It was interesting to see a few parts of Montreal I'd never seen: the Lachine <a href="16_07_06_1323.html">marina</a>, the <a href="16_07_06_1355.html">Fleming Mill </a>with a France-French festival with live music right there, the Lachine lakeshore bike path.</p>
<p>I put a couple of phone pics in the <a href="hotsummer-5.html">gallery</a> - wow, what a difference a crappy phone cam makes compared to a real camera <img src="../gif/icon_sad-3.gif" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley"/>  - and I even recorded a little clip of people surfing at the Lachine rapids, but it'll take more effort to get that online.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195755/http://www.deadsquid.com/~longman/gallery/hotsummer/16_07_06_1411" class="gallery_link"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195755im_/http://www.deadsquid.com/~longman/gallery/albums/hotsummer/16_07_06_1411.thumb.jpg" class="gallery_image" alt="[img]"/></a></p>
<p>I'll have to figure out a way to get the GPS data out of my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195755/http://www.garmin.com/products/forerunner201/">watch</a> so that I can plot the route.</p>
<p>Afterwards I went up to grab some eats at Euro-deli and hung out with Rob for a bit.  On the way home, I had to wade through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195755/http://www.hahaha.com/">Just For Laughs</a> festival.  There I saw a number of board games set up by Loto Quebec, a Dancing Table </p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195755/http://www.deadsquid.com/~longman/gallery/hotsummer/16_07_06_2132" class="gallery_link"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195755im_/http://www.deadsquid.com/~longman/gallery/albums/hotsummer/16_07_06_2132.thumb.jpg" class="gallery_image" alt="[img]"/></a></p>
<p>and a busker or two.  </p>
<p>All in all, a nice day.  I'm not sure if I'm any less fat, as I immediately felt a need to restore some of the salt I'd lost, but it was really nice.  </p>

								<p>Also, sunday night one of Joan's favourite artists, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195755/http://www.barringtonlevy.com/" rel="nofollow">Barrington Levy</a> played in the old port, which she didn't realize until he was keeping us awake, playing her favourite songs, and tonight, Live is playing a free show in the old port, which we only recognized because the Lightning Crashes is so recognizable.</p>
<p>It'd be nice if I could find a website that lists <em>all</em> the artists playing in my living room.</p>
<p>(Oh, btw, its quite loud...)

								<p>Cycling helps, but based on cycling ~23k a day to work it ain't all that based on my summertime weight gain.  It can't even keep up with summertime beer drinking!  </p>
<p>I find that good old running is best.  But it's fewer sights and boring.
