				<h1>Wither the wiither withers...</h1>
				<p>I was late for work this morning as I was playing with the Wii weather update.  It's fun to spin the globe around and look at the weather in many different places.  Very educational, I'm sure Americans will find it frustrating.</p>
<p>Anyways, what I was *really* impressed by was that the constellations may be accurate.  Although I'm not certain of the day-time position of Orion during the winter, I'm familiar with its night position.  And if you looked over the shoulder of Europe then you found the Warrior.</p>
<p>I couldn't see how you'd easily change the time and date in order to see the summer night sky, or the evening winter sky, so I'm not sure.  I also just got home from work so I might not check tonight.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm not entirely sure I'm entirely pleased with Wii Weather.  I guess what I wanted was an instant-on kind of weather, something that would be very appliance-y and easy to turn on quickly before walking the dogs, etc.   Wii weather takes a couple of seconds to start, as well as requiring the wii-mote.</p>
<p>I'd really like to see something which is passively useful.  Informational screensavers, information on <a title="utopia" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070206223153/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399201/">led signs</a>,  and so on.  I'd even like to have MythTV create it's own commercials of programs <em>I've</em> recorded.<br/>
Still it was fun.  Now I'm really wondering what Wii News will be like.

<p>I got coffee up my nose because of this.</p>
<p>Here's my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070206223153/http://kev.needham.ca/images" rel="nofollow">solution for the weather</a>. I imagine you could do the same with an LCD display if the myth box is always on.
