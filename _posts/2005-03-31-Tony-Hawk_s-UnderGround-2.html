				<h1>Tony Hawk's UnderGround 2</h1>
					<p>A couple of months ago I picked up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023083246/http://www.activision.com/microsite/thug2/">THUG2<img align="left" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023083246im_/http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/B0002CNUN0/ref=dp_product-image-only_0/002-5634486-6435263?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;n=468642&amp;s=videogames"/></a> on eBay for about $20 off retail. I've played (and finished) every Tony Hawk game except THUG (1) and handheld versions, but still covering DreamCast, Playstation, Playstation 2 and GameCube.</p>
	<p>Anyways, this isn't really intended as a review, but rather a statement of progress.  At the normal level I've completed Story and Classic mode, I'm a couple of goals away from completing insane classic mode (which is Insane), and every now and then I switch back to the story mode at the insane level.</p>
	<p>I think it's important to have a record of where my time is wasted.  So when I'm at the gates, defending my life, I can say, 'I finished THUG2 at insane level!', and Saint Peter will go, 'NO way, dude!'.  Like that.</p>
