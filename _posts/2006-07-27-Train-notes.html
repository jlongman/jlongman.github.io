				<h1>Train notes</h1>
				<p>I'm just leaving Union Station, and it occurred to me that I know nothing about how VIA achieves their wifi-on-the-train.  Apparently they're using <em>update:GPRS and</em> satellite, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231910/http://www.xiplink.com/">Charlie</a>, and they need help with latency.  I'm also a little concerned that I might be registering with another train, and I don't know if they've centralized the accounts off-train.  Worse case is I've paid $10 for 10 minutes of access and then I spend the rest of the train working with the code and documents I brought with me.</p>
<p>To my Tarannian deadsquid friends, I'm just leaving the Big Smoke, but I will be back Monday.  This week wasn't really a great chance to hang out anyways but I think next week will be better.  The first week went cool although a bit slow, but I imagine that's normal for beginnings.  </p>
<p>Technically, I didn't know what to expect coming into this, but right now I'm pretty excited.   My belief is that once we put some commitments into order we should be able to move at a very rapid pace.  The team seems competent and also experienced at playing multiple roles.</p>
<p>The other thing I did while in TO was check out some of the folding bikes I've had my eye on for a while.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231910/http://www.ucycle.com/">Urbane Cycle</a> had <em>exactly</em> the model I'd been drooling over on the net - the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231910/http://www.dahon.com/us/speedprott.htm">Dahon Speed Pro TT</a>.  Unfortunately, the price is higher than I hoped but closer to about what I was afraid it would be.  Maybe next week I will have enough free time to test drive it to determine if it, or maybe a cheaper cousin, could replace <a href="index0735-15.html?p=18">my non-folding bike</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, I should get some work done...</p>
