				<h1>2 Gigs!</h1>
				<p>On the train up to Toronto I checked out IntelliJ 6.0&beta; and TeamCity, (as noted before).  Well, IntelliJ was *terrible* - but it wasn't <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070123204441/http://www.jetbrain.com/">Jetbrains</a>'s fault.  My MacBook only had 512MB of RAM in it, and desperately needed a brain augmentation.</p>
<p>Saturday I'd ordered some RAM from TigerDirect and Tuesday it arrived.  The screwdriver required to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070123204441/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303721">upgrade memory</a> is fairly small, so it took me some time to find the right screwdriver (i.e. cash outlay).  </p>
<p>The first time after I had tried to install the memory, it didn't work.  It takes a fair amount of pressure to get the memory properly seated, so much so that I had to brace against the outside of the laptop so that I was climber-style pinching (a large open hand grip) the laptop in order to get it in.  Next, stuffing the EMI shielding back into place - since it expands inside of the RAM slot - was a bit difficult.  Finally, 2 Glorious Gigs of RAM.</p>
<p>And it's fast.  I've seen the busy-beach ball once since then, and I'm running Eclipse AND IntelliJ and Firefox and Mail and Adium and Quicksilver and an IRC client, etc, etc, etc, without any problems.  Sweet.
