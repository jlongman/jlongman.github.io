					<p>I can't connect the data services, which would be pretty freakin' cool. I spoke with 3 customer reps at Rogers (they sold me a special data plan, which has the first two months free, woop), and even <em>Nokia</em> support.   All useless.  Eventually I found online that I'm not the only one with this problem. </p>
	<p>Sigh. (I'll add links to this entry when I have time)</p>
