				<h1>Wet Weekend Wildness!</h1>
				<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231448/http://www.pbase.com/gashford/rumney_may_24_2005"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231448im_/http://i.pbase.com/u26/gashford/small/43716415.7_s.jpg" alt="group wet shot, graham's" align="right"/>Graham</a> and a group of climbers from Ottawa invited me up to Rumney, NH for a wee bit of climbing.  Well, actually they invited me up for a lot of climbing, but 'wee' was all that was left given the 'fantastic' rain.  </p>
<p>Still I did some leading in the 5.10 range, and although I didn't do spectacularly, at least I feel I accomplished what I wanted to (in the limited time even!) and it certainly motivates me to get back into it.  Really nice people who are themselves strongly motivated  and encouraging do that.  </p>
<p>I think Mel put it best, although she was talking about x-country skiing, the people who are there choose to be there and they are all really happy!</p>
<p>To be honest, after the 12 hours of rain and almost getting gassed at 4am by the people who had to retreat into the car when their tent got soaked (poor girls!), I was happy to head home.  But I would have been much happier bashing my head against some dry rock!
