				<h1>N95 networking</h1>
				<p>Everything worked swimmingly on my WEP network at home.  Unfortunately work was a bit more challenging.  It ended up that the <a title="this wasn't it" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080102005209/http://discussions.europe.nokia.com/discussions/board/message?board.id=connectivity&amp;message.id=7245">WPA-PSK</a> wasn't really an issue, what WAS an issue was that the wireless router had had its DHCP server turned off and instead the Cisco PIX behind it was responsible for DHCP.  Which never arrived at the phone, I guess.  In any case, using a fixed IP solved the problem.  Badda Boom Badda Bing!</p>
<p><a title="im and voip" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080102005209/http://www.fring.com/">Fring</a>'s Skype-call quality left something to be desired.  I'm kind of wondering if they are proxy'ing Skype through a VOIP gateway.  Yikes.  In any case, it works(!), which is pretty cool.  It also reminded me how to use the Series 60 cut and paste, which should be a mandatory part of learning how to use your phone, ala Graffiti tutorial on the Palm.</p>
<p>As you can imagine I've downloaded a number of applications: 10, so far.  <a title="itunes like suscriber" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080102005209/http://europe.nokia.com/podcasting">Nokia podcasting</a> (nice, audio and video), Amazon Anywhere (what a waste), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080102005209/http://www.fring.com/">fring</a>, f-secure (virus software!?), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080102005209/http://www.shozu.com/portal/index.do">Shozu</a> (maybe I'll get a flickr account, and it allows you to Geo-tag photos), <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080102005209/http://research.nokia.com/research/projects/SportsTracker/">Sports Tracker</a> (gps + exercise, ala Garmin Forerunner), Calcium (a simple calculator), Google maps (more maps!), <a title="email capable" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080102005209/http://www.scanr.com/">scanR</a> (a remote document processor that has done wonders with our whiteboard photos), oh and the gmail client, which I still haven't tried.</p>
<p>I like Nokia Podcasting as I've never really listened to podcasts on anything except my Shuffle, which for me meant the device you listen from was disparate to the device you made your decisions on.  Google maps really seems to be dependant on a network connection while you're away from your wifi access point, which in Canada means it is essentially useless.   Shame, it really appears well implemented.</p>
<p>Scanr looks really cool and I could see it becoming an essential tool in our office.  We've been performing 'Startegie' (sic) meetings and been using the MacBook Pro iSight to capture the whiteboards.  The sucker transcribing the 640×480 images asked for help interpreting the architect's chicken scratch and then saw my pictures taken at 3 MegaPixel (really, who needs all 5?) processed by the the scanr output and let me know he'd be by often to borrow my phone.  What's nice is that I should be able to take the pictures on my phone, send them to scanr and receive the processed results, without ever involving a desktop.  (I still have to validate whether I can speak to an smtp server yet, so this remains to be seen.)</p>
<p>Finally, the last little thing I did was update the <a title="Nokia iSync plugin" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080102005209/http://www.nokia.com/A4299040">iSync</a> plugin on my mac to support the N95.  I'm sad that although I can have the Mac unlock the screen when my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080102005209/http://www.technocrat.ca/?p=44">bluetooth MAC shows up</a>, it won't show me the callerId on the mac as apparently the N95/OS X support doesn't go that far.</p>
<p>I've since then updated most everyone's photo in my OSX Address Book and then sync'ed with the phone. So now, in addition to having Stephen Hawking read the caller's name, the phone will show a picture of my friend in a compromising position.  Now that's what <strong>I</strong> call technological progress.

								<p>On howardforums there is a Marketplace forum, which has a vendor in Montreal on Sainte-Catherine's.  I think the website is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080102005209/http://www.gsmphone-unlocking.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gsmphone-unlocking.com.</a></p>

								<p>Incidentally, I've experienced a few crashes (notably while doing heavy networking things - voip and web running at the same time for example) so I'm looking at upgrading the firmware even though my 'product code' isn't quite valid for the firmware.  (Apparently nokia hasn't heard of the global village)</p>

<p>I tried last night but the only Windows machine I had access to has brain dead USB drivers.  God I hate Windows.
