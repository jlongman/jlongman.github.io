				<h1>Shower Power</h1>
				<p>Based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195205/http://www.redflagdeals.com/">redflag</a>'s and Leif's recommendations, last night I picked up an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195205/http://gateway.canadiantire.ca/driver.php?fileid=2534374303514603_1408474395348027_845524443248666_">Oxygenics </a>Shower Head for $20 at Home Depot.  It's a lo-flo shower head which aerates the water in a jet-like fashion.  It kind feels like you're being hit by round drops instead of a stream, or you're standing in a stream of bubbles.  Nicer than most lo-flos I've tried (mostly hostels).</p>
<p>Anywho, I'm excited to save the bunnies (not the killer ones, but the rest, y'know?) and save money on the electricity bill.  What's really funny is I'm not sure if it is the 'aerated' action or maybe if I couldn't tell that the water was REALLY hot (which I kinda realized at first) but anyways, I was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195205/http://images.google.ca/images?q=naked%20lobster">LOBSTER</a> red after the first shower.  The second shower resulted in non-strangeness.</p>
<p>I also installed an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195205/http://content.honeywell.com/yourhome/ptc-thermostats/CT1950.htm">electronic thermostat</a> - but I'm not convinced thats not going to cost more money.  Heating the space in my apartment is a very weird thing - partially because of the high ceilings and the smoker who opens the windows and so on - so I think we used to always leave the heat off...  And now it turns itself on!  I'll have to keep turning it down until its unbearable. <img src="../gif/icon_smile-27.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"/>

								<p>Nice, I think I remember some of those showerheads while traipsing across Europe. They tend to dribble out little spurts of tepid water as you carefully sidestep the vomit and try not to touch the body shavings from the hirsute Portugese punter who just got out of the shower before you...

								<p>Alive and well.</p>
<p>I was talking about other people at the hostels. There was always some nasty Portugest guy who left a hair ring in the drain of those places. Shoot me an email. Credit running down at internet cafe. Peace. J
