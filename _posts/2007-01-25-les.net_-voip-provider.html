<blockquote><p>bastard operator from hell mode: ENGAGED<br/>
Please do <strong>*NOT*</strong> call if you are having problems.<br/>
Especially, do not call to complain or ask if there is a way to fix it temporarily.<br/>
Each minute I spend on the phone explaining things, delays the final solution.<br/>
I realise that your communications is important, but you will just have to cope in the meantime, sorry!<br/>
I can understand if people would like to cancel and find another provider.<br/>
I will process any such request on the weekend if you choose that direction.<br/>
