				<h1>Joan's a Blogger</h1>
					<p>Dang!  My <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044846/http://clutzymonkey.blogspot.com/">girlfriend</a> now has a forum to explain how evil she wants you to believe I am!  Given that she studied literature, I know I stand for everyone with very, very high expectations of writing.   We're talking better than the Koala Tea Of Mercy Is Not Strained here.</p>
	<p>Seriously, I've encouraged her to blog because I think Technical Writers are in danger of forgetting how to write creatively.  Let's sit back and watch, shall we?</p>
