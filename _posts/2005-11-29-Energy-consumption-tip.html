				<h1>Energy consumption tip</h1>
				<p>A warm blanket can do wonders for keeping the heat down.  Personally I'd choose a goose down duvet - there's a place here in Montreal that will do a queen size super thick one for $300 with a ten year warranty.  Unfortunately, Joan is allergic to everything, so Ikea had a king-size synthetic duvet that is very down-like and super warm.   I think it retails for $120 before, I got it from the As-is section for $99 with tax.  Don't worry, I took the tacks out.  I mean, don't worry, we washed it.</p>
<p>Joan still has a problem with it being TOO warm.  I have an extra sheet on and I find it nice and toasty.

 good to know<br/>
Down and feathers used by IKEA are never taken from living birds.

<p>Which doesn't necessarily clear things ethically, but it does improve matters.

								<p>[...] By the way, I'm quite happy to say that even though it has dropped to -10&degr;C, we haven't turned on the electric heaters yet. This is due to two things: the water radiators have been working almost non-stop so far this year, and the big warm blanket. [...]

								<p>I thought I had read that synthetic was actually worse for allergies over time?  I was reading an article trying to explain why allergies are increasinly common and one of the things they pointed to was newer (cheaper, â€˜modern') synthetic pillows and such.
