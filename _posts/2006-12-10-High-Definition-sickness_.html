				<h1>High Definition sickness...</h1>
				<p>Unsurprisingly, I caught the super-virus going around the world.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my HD ATSC tuner arrived thursday.  It's a <a title="link to hdhomerun site" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207232108/http://www.silicondust.com/zxc/content/view/5/26/">HDHomeRun</a> box,  an <a title="Digital Television over-the-air" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207232108/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATSC">ATSC</a> and <a title="cable - but un-encrypted qam" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207232108/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation">QAM</a>  dual-tuner network-streamer capture thingamajigger...  Basically it can receive SD and HDTV feeds, strip out some of the unnecessary or unwanted bits from the Transport Stream and send it to a client like <a title="Streaming via UDP" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207232108/http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> or, more relevant to us, MythTV.</p>
<p>Actually, Friday I stayed home from work sick but then ended up working all day.  It's just as well as I postponed the pain.</p>
<p>Anyways, I've learned a couple of things over the weekend:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a title="you have to login to read it" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207232108/http://mysettopbox.tv/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=11558">0.20 update to the R5D1</a> release of Knoppmyth wouldn't tune any of the channels that I could see using the command line tool</li>
<li>apparently I needed 0.20-fixes</li>
<li>which means I'd have to update every version of Myth running on my network, due to protocol changes</li>
<li>I compiled it and installed it over top of the afore-mentioned install
<ul>
<li>Using debian packages, so hopefully it's reversible, not including the db?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>None of the machines I own are powerful enough to decode HDTV except for my MacBook
<ul>
<li>Not the Athlon 2600 I installed in the front room so I can game and Joan can watch MythTV,</li>
<li>The P4 2400 with HyperThreading nor</li>
<li>The G4 Mac Mini which I had to download a pre-compiled binary for</li>
<li>Even the macbook is struggling, but I think it worked well when I was watching it last night</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Damn it looks good on my macbook, except</li>
<li>I have '<a title="a known problem" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207232108/http://www.google.ca/search?q=sparkles+westinghouse+lvm-42w2">sparkles</a>' on my Westinghouse LVM-42w2on all the inputs
<ul>
<li>maybe it's not the same issue?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I can't use my laptop while watching HD.</li>
<li>I need to decide whether to pull down the plastic weatherstripping from the skylight to move the antenna to improve reception.  I'm too dizzy to do that right now.</li>
<li>I can detect the encrypted QAM channels but they make MythTV very unhappy.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's all very cool.  But I realized that when you've got a fever you're pretty sensitive to irritation.</p>
<p>And I've got a VOIP box waiting in the background too... <img src="../gif/icon_wink-33.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley"/>

								<p>In between bouts of fever I discovered that the video card in the other system <em>should</em> be able to decode 1080i.  Except for the analog encoder card requires software compression consuming CPU cycles.  Of course, if I had the encoder machine squirreled behind the climbing wall and gave up the playback machine in the front room... </p>

								<p>[...] I switched the video cards and the system looks like it is doing quite well - almost - the digital audio keeps dropping out.  At this point I'm wondering if this is an IRQ problem as a couple of things which are sharing IRQs (the video card and the capture cards) are sharing irq's.  Or it could be a PCI bandwidth/latency problem.  Or it could be the wrong driver.
