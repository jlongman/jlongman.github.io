					<p>Well. Probably the most disappointing thing is the pic didn't post. (maybe a permissions problem on the server though)  In addition it crashed my palm – although it did repost the entry (3 times).  and it didn't take the Timestamp from the software.  So I may as well use the web panel – or write my own!</p>
