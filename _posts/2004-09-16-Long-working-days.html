				<h1>Long working days</h1>
					<p>After a Hockey Cup, after insomnia,  a 16 hour workday, after MORE insomnia, another 16 hour working day shaping up.  Actually, that's VERY unlikely as the traffic this morning was horrific and I was too stunned to bike in.  It definitely would have been faster.</p>
