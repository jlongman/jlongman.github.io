				<h1>Climbing Video Cottage Industry</h1>
				<p>I occasionally scan a US deal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207230836/http://www.techbargains.com/">site</a> and I came across <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207230836/http://www.akimbo.com/">akimbo</a>, which frankly I don't wish to condone as I've never seen the service, but it piqued my interest.</p>
<p>Briefly, akimbo is television on demand for anyone (in the US and Canada) with broadband, in the same way that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207230836/http://www.vonage.com/">vonage</a> and VOIP is bringing telephone on demand.  Frankly the current technology is unimpressive, and as yet, the selection is unimpressive, but what is impressive is the opportunity for potentially anyone to be a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207230836/http://akimbo.com/howto_provide.html">content provider</a>.</p>
<p>The content providers link is at the same level as the subscribers channel options.  I think this is significant because it opens the door to anyone providing content. Given ubiquitious deployment, and I don't see why this couldn't be added to every Tivo out there, it permits special interest groups to connect with themselves in the same way <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207230836/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting">podcasting</a> does.  </p>
<p>Years ago, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207230836/http://mlang.servehttp.com/extralocal/">John</a> and I put together an amateur climbing video from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207230836/http://www.climbers.org/rock/rock.html#Lion's%20Head">Lion's Head, Ontario</a>.  We also have 20 hours of unedited (amateur, of course!) footage from all over France and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207230836/http://www.norope.com/gallery.php?path=HP40">Alabama</a>.</p>
<p>Well, imagine we got paid $CDN0.25 for each viewing (I suspect that is generous, but anyways...).  How many viewings would it take for us to break even?  Less than 40000, and we've covered the cost of our trip, our camera and our editing solution (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207230836/http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">iMovie</a>, in case you're curious <img src="../gif/icon_wink-31.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley"/> )  It helps that the Mac was borrowed.</p>
<p>People have tried to make climbing videos available on line before. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207230836/http://www.climbxmedia.com/">ClimbXMedia</a> tried to do it, but eventually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207230836/http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:0RRgbP_cUaoJ:camp4.com/rock.php%3Fnewsid%3D464+climbxmedia&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a">realized</a> they couldn't make money doing it.  cXm was a distributor though, as far as I know, and the details  they had with the film distributors are unknown to me.  But essentially, they were advertiser supported and the films were available for free to the internet public. </p>
<p>Climbing videos used to be in the $60 range, but now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207230836/http://www.mec.ca/">mec</a> has them for about $30.  I think the difference in price is the result of film capturing, editing and DVD mastering becoming extremely affordable but also the increased size of the climbing community.</p>
<p>So basically the opportunity is there for anyone to produce the video.  The question is whether they can achieve a semi-professional quality that is acceptable to the American public, and I suspect reality TV might help with that.  Also what happens when every climber, oeniphile, or DIYer or SIGer has a camera and thinks that they can be the next cottage success?

<p>You get the opportunity to build a content-rich community for like-mined individuals. Like, say... blogging <img src="../gif/icon_smile-31.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"/> </p>
<p>I think the vids are analagous to podcasting. There's a lot of content that just won't fly in the mainstream, and I think it's fair to say climbing is one of them. The main issue is that people who don't climb can't appreciate what they're seeing, and so the appeal isn't there.</p>
<p>A great example is Tony Hawk <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207230836/http://espn.go.com/xgames/summerx99/skate/news/1999/990628/01329413.html" rel="nofollow">pulling a 900 in competition</a>. Watch the vid - the crowd goes apeshit when he lands it, but most people who have never seen a competition before would say 'what's the deal?'.</p>
<p>Same thing goes for a lot of other stuff, and that's why the appeal is in the cottage industry. You can get kick-ass DV cameras (like Canon's 3CCD stuff) for a grand on ebay. You've pointed out the editing solutions which can be $100 or so, and others are available for another $1,000-$1,500 that increase the quality dramatically, plus the cost of a workstation which most people already have. </p>
<p>It's a cottage industry, and will stay that way (my opinion), but it's no longer inaccessible technology to create the product. There are a lot of people who <em>do</em> appreciate the kind of content you're talking about, the trick is making them aware of it and how they can get it.</p>
<p>That's the hard part. <img src="../gif/icon_smile-31.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"/>

								<p>This is potentially the opportunity that akimbo is providing.   Profit-Free Content distribution is already available - e.g. rss/bittorrent, etc.  Akimbo've tied in centi-payments into a central content repository.  (The centralization isn't particularly important, except in finding the resources and collecting the payments).</p>
<p>Oh and there's no reason that Open Source (say <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207230836/http://www.mythtv.org/" rel="nofollow">myth</a>) can't replicate the same thing.  The money is the tricky part.

								<p>hrmm....</p>
<p>My point was that the technology and the content wasn't the issue. It's the marketing. While Akimbo may provide a platform, it's still Internet centric, and I don't recall seeing a whole lot of google searches which point to akimbo content. The challenge, and therefore the work, is identifying your target audience and making them aware of what you have.</p>
<p>We're lucky in that word of mouth is sooooo much easier today, but you still have to seed the ideas. </p>
<p>You've got me thinking now, damn you.

								<p>I think you mean, 'Occasionally, my ass!'.  But I like the way you think.</p>
<p>And its the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207230836/http://www.redflagdeals.com/" rel="nofollow">Canadian</a> one I scan obsessively, not the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207230836/http://www.techbargains.com/" rel="nofollow">American</a> one.
