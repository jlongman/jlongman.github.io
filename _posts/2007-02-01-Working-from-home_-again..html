				<h1>Working from home, again.</h1>
				<p>We're transitioning our office from the South Shore of Montreal to downtown, not far from the Molson Centre.  This basically marks the fruition of my plan to stop driving to work, which I've mostly regularly done since the (second) last company I worked for went down the toilet, February 2006 I guess.</p>
<p>I'm sick of driving, especially in Montreal, and I'm really happy to be able to get back on the wheels and blades.  The drivers here are terrible, especially when I'm on the road... <img src="../gif/icon_wink-3.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley"/>  But basically the whole idea of driving makes me ill.  There's so much *mass* that needs to be moved just to get your pasty white fat ass from point A to point B.  Riding a bike is efficient and fun usually.  Of course, now I'll be a biker in a driver's world...  But at least I can play my holier-than-thou card while they're wiping my brains off the asphalt.</p>
<p>Oh the other fun fact about working from home is I can hook my work computer or my home macbook up to the 42″ TV.  With only the coffee table in front of it and me it's still obvious I need new glasses.  Doing 1080p at 42″ is still 52dpi.   But I'm further back than I'd like to be.</p>
<p>... back to work...

								<p>Just a slight delay while the Internet powers that be *actually* do work for money that we've given them.  I'm not sure how much of the problem is sheer infrastructure, versus businesses that don't realize we gave them money and expect something in return.  Like, right away.</p>
<p>I actually took a gander at the offices, for the first time, today.  Nice.  Not 'discreet' nice, but nice.  They'll be even nicer with the Intarweeb.
