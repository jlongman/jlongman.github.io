				<h1>Yellow Tape</h1>
				<p>I set a bouldering problem at the gym last night - everyone else was done or climbing routes by 9pm last night, so I had an open canvas in front of me.  Typically I'm climbing someone else's problem (e.g. Larry's) or the taped problems as they tend to differ from my style. If they are my style, too easy, and then I'm not working what I really need, which is technique.</p>
<p>I tend to set 'fun' problems rather than 'hard' problems - partially because I want to take it easy on my tendons and partially because I lose interest in non-fun problems when climbing (and setting) alone.  </p>
<p>I like to set problems with wide arcs in them - as I find the interesting moves are usually when you throw your shoulders in a horizontal line or twist them perpendicular to the wall in order to apply force in unusual directions - and these moves lend themselves to traverses.  And they tend to go up, as there's only so much wall to go over, especially when you run out of unique coloured tape to mark it with. Finally, I tend to favour dynamic moves as I've never really been as strong as everyone else so I focused on dynamic accuracy.  ('Pretend your fingers are the arrowhead, your forearm the arrow and your body and arm the bow'...<em>sfffffft</em>!)  <a id="more-242"/></p>
<p>The basic principle was: from good hands a long throw to a medium-good hold, cross up to a thin crimp, another crimp, cross to a slightly-better medium hold.  Hike your left foot high and left then see if I can throw high-left around a corner to a rail sloper.  Switch your feet and now put your left foot high a chip on the nearly vertical face.  Muscle up to a round sloper, get both hands on it, then its another foot up and in to the top, which I didn't know how it would go.</p>
<p>And this one I screwed with the starting holds because it began on the same holds as one of the older warmups and I wanted something more original.  But then I ended up starting off of a problem that had been mostly taken down, but it did add a couple of moves to the problem.  I'm not happy that it feels a bit forced, but the move's not without character.  </p>
<p>It's now a low <abbr title="Sit Down Start">SDS</abbr> in front of the kick-panel just to the right of the middle of the 45&deg; wall with your left hand and foot in front of you and right hand and foot at then right end of the wall.  Right hand goes straight up a foot into the 45 to a big right facing hold, while your lower body torques opposite the barn door while on the starting feet.  Hike your right foot inline with your right hand, and pop up a couple of feet to the medium-good hold mentioned above in the description.</p>
<p>Early on I had a hard time deciding where to go from the top sloper red hold - I didn't think I could make the top from it, and everything else that was near was too good.  I worked the top a couple of times and eventually found that if I did a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231735/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=kip">kip</a> - actually a double reverse-kick, monkey- or squirrel- tail -like move - I could top out during my falling down and out movement.  It's a slopey hold!.  However, while taping the problem I managed to get a brush up there which helped a lot. </p>
<p>The other thing I figgered out is if I keep the left foot high on its left chip and then flag delicately(!)  — danger! slopey hold! — my right foot over by my left foot then I can actually pull on the sloper until I'm touching the top.  </p>
<p>Later someone else, tired after climbing all night, gave ‘er a shot.  What was interesting is that he took the crimps and such to his right as feet, forcing his body horizontal (as mentioned above) and mimicking one of the other problems in the wall (just right-to-left instead of left-to-right).  That's not how I pictured it going.  However, he had a hard time sticking the throw up and around the corner to the right, which I can see being hard from the alternate position.  I'll have to see how if I can send it that way. </p>
<p>So basically, it's a 2 degrees-of-freedom dyno throw, some small crimps, a 3 degrees-of-freedom throw to a slopey rail, lie-back balancey-flag-haul to a slope, and then the sloper haul-off to the top.  And I like it.  Anyways, I sent it before the end of the evening, which makes me think it wasn't very hard, but it <em>is</em> a lot of fun and  it's probably too easy for me.  Nor is it working my technique issues!  </p>
<p>But it was fun to create something and leave it for others to try.

								<p>J, you'd love bouldering with us at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231735/http://www.coyoterockgym.ca/" title="WEB 0.02" rel="nofollow">gym</a>.  We make a lot of problems, most of them 'fun'.</p>
<p>We'll try explain the ‘Brown Monster' to you - it's a route that G and I set <em>(quoted as being set by ‘Dave-Graham')</em>.  It goes at about V4.  I think it's down now.
