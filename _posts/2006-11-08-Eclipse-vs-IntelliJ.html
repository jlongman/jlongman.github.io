				<h1>Eclipse vs IntelliJ</h1>
				<p>Over the last two months at the new job I've been using a new (for me) <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> from <a title="JetBrains" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924115016/http://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains </a>called IntelliJ IDEA, or IntelliJ.  IntelliJ pioneered a lot of the IDE refactoring in the Java world, but they're also a pay solution whereas Eclipse is free, as in beer _and_ as in speech.
<p>Nic sent me a link to an IntelliJ <a title="eclipse vs intellij collection" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924115016/http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/2006/11/eclipse-vs-intellij/">blog entry</a> that is collecting reviews comparing the two.  I may have to write one, later when I'm more familiar with IntelliJ.<br/></p>
In the meantime though, one feature I'm definitely missing in IntelliJ is 'click-highlighting'.</p>
<p>In Eclipse, If I click on a variable then every usage of that variable is highlighted in the document and in the scrollbar for easy scrolling to the relevant location.  And it uses zero screen real-estate - I find IntelliJ a lot less dense than eclipse (which is probably good for beginners, not so much for power-users).</p>
<p>Similarly, if you click on the return term, then the points in the method which return are highlighted.  If you click on an exception, the points where that exception are thrown are highlighted.</p>
<p>These are unbelievably useful for grokking other people's code.

								<p>We deploy all of our J2EE apps to BEA's Weblogic Server system.</p>
<p>With their latest version 9.2 of the Weblogic Server their Development IDE has switched to now being Eclipse based.</p>
<p>Having only played around in eclipse briefly before, I can see how it will work well in place of their old development IDE 'Weblogic Workshop'.</p>
<p>I'm on course this week and we're using it, unfortunately I'm not sure if it is the shitty machine configuration, a shitty installation, or the product itself, but it seems to be hanging and freezing quite a bit.</p>
<p>One person, who probabaly hasn't used it anymore than I have, piped in saying that regularly eclipse is super stable, and its when they build these extra perspectives that it's stability wanes.</p>
<p>We'll have to see becuase if it hangs this much during regular development I'll be moving on to something else.

								<p>Control-Shift-F7 highlights a variable or method in a file.  Nowhere as easy to use as Eclipse, but it's there.  Phew!  Missing that one was really hurting.
