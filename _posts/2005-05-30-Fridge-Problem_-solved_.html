				<h1>Fridge Problem, solved!</h1>
					<p>Finally, picked up a Fridge from the Sears Clearance centre in Montreal.  Frankly, there's some awesome deals there.  We got a black Kenmore bottom-mount 18 cu.ft. Fridge for $700, including taxes.  A little bit beat up, but still has a 1 year warranty.</p>
	<p>Now we just wait for delivery...</p>
