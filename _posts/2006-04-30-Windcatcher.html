				<p>I think I mentioned this to someone the other night.  It took a while to find it again, but I did.  It's an ancient Persian system known as a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114550/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badgir">Windcatcher</a> or <i>Badgir</i>.  Basically, it's believed that, warm air flowing over the tip of the tower pulls the hot air out of the bottom of the tower.</p>
<blockquote><p>The pressure gradient then helps lift rising warmer air leaving the cooler air behind at the base. The cumulative effect over a 24 hour period is quite noticeable.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems to me adapting it for Canada should be quite possible.   You'd just really need to insulate it well in the winter.  I'd love to set this up in our apartment, if it were possible.
