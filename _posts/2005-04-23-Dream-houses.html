				<h1>Dream houses</h1>
				<p>I want to build my own house some day.  I want it to be as geek gizmo as I am, and I want it to environmentally break even, or heck, why not dream, even be a net positive.</p>

<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195226/http://www.ourcoolhouse.com/">This</a> guy is a bit of a geek, but he's done some interesting stuff.  I'm happy I found his site though, as he uses earth-sheltering which is a concept which I'd read about, and then lost the reference to it.  He's also definitely a geek, as he's used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195226/http://www.ibutton.com/">iButton</a>'s 1-wire temperature sensors to monitor the heat exchanger in his system.  (I have an iButton somewhere - it actually has a Java VM on it.) (I was thinking a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195226/http://www.gumstix.com/">gumstix</a> might be a fun low-power platform...)</li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195226/http://www.glenhunter.ca/index.html">Glen Hunter</a> has also done some interesting things, I especially like the Gaudi-esque ceiling ideas and the fact that he's disconnected from the power grid.  Oh, and he's made his own LED lighting...</li>
