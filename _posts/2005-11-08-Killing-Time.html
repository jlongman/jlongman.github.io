				<h1>Killing Time</h1>
				<p>I wasn't in a very active mental state this weekend, so I'm proud/ashamed to say that I put a large number of hours into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195420/http://www.google.com/search?q=wipeout+fusion">wipeout fusion</a>.  Completed 'AG League' and most Challenge mode.  Two of the challenges which remain I don't think I will ever get.</p>
<p>Now I think I would like the sound of the missile lock-on sound for my phone.</p>
<p>End of line.
