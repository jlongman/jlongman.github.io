				<h1>Eclipse on OS X</h1>
				<p>Do you know what pisses me off about the OS X port of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114803/http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>?  I go to all the trouble of getting a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114803/http://shop.store.yahoo.com/pfuca-store/haphackeylit1.html">happy hacking keyboard</a>, so I can put the Control key in the right place - and the bloody bastards move the Control key to the Propeller key.</p>
<p>(Which is where the Windows key is, for you Intel people)</p>
<p>And even so, it's half-assed.  You know why?   Because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114803/http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/">Spotlight</a> has Propeller-Space, which means Control-Space (y'know, auto-think, i.e. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114803/http://help.eclipse.org/help30/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/samples/org.eclipse.ui.examples.javaeditor/doc-html/ui_javaeditor_ex.html">Content Assist</a>) can't be mapped to Propeller-Space.  </p>
<p>So what else hasn't been mapped to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114803/http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery;jsessionid=40oegve4hprtp?method=4&amp;dsid=2291&amp;dekey=%2FF%2Ffeature-key.html&amp;gwp=8&amp;curtab=2291_1&amp;sbid=lc02a&amp;linktext=%3Ci%20class%3D%22glossterm%22%3Efeature%20key%3C%2Fi%3E">Propeller</a>?</p>

</table>
<p>which is,<br/>
Propeller-Q quits the application.<br/>
Propeller-D, dunno?<br/>
Propeller-H hides the window.</p>
<p>The Windows version doesn't use the Windows key, you could imagine the problems that would cause.   So... if you can't do a proper job with Propeller, and I can't see why you can't stay with Control,  why did they do it?  </p>
<p>(I think the real mistake was using Propeller-keys as global keys)</p>
<p>(update: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114803/http://digg.com/apple/How_the_unusual_symbol_for_the_Apple_Command_Key_came_to_be">Propeller</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114803/http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Swedish_Campground.txt">propeller</a>.)
