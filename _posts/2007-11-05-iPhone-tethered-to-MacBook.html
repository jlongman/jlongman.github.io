				<h1>iPhone tethered to MacBook</h1>
				<p>There's a trick to getting my iPhone to ad-hoc network with my MacBook and share it's connection.  <a title="it works, too, I imagine" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071121044750/http://groups.google.com/group/iphonewebdev/browse_thread/thread/39c12b7dd60ac5de/">This</a> is what I saw first, and they basically suggest changing the iPhone to Manual config and entering the DNS server in the iPhone itself.<br/>
However, a slightly better solution, IMHO, and at-least-on-Leopard, I have to restart Internet Connection Sharing if I want my iPhone to get working DNS.  I did also set the DNS server in the Advanced panel of the Airport, and it may not be necessary, but that's easier to do in MacBook land then iPhone land, thanks to Cut and Paste.</p>
<p>(I'll probably validate whether it is required later)
