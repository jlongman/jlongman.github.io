				<h1>Cygwin and (at least) x64</h1>
				<p>I don't know exactly what happened, but for the longest time my cygwin installation has been boned.  I thought maybe the dll had got corrupted, wouldn't re-install properly, etc.,etc.,  but now I suspect something was just *wrong*.  And they've since corrected it, and an update made me happy.  So if you miss you rxvt on windows...  Update!</p>
<p>(It still annoyingly doesn't pass on the break signal to the java process, but I'm used to that)
