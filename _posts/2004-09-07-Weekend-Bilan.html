				<h1>Weekend Bilan</h1>
					<p>What a glorious weekend, spent at Graham's cottage.  I'll have to see if there are any other pics than those of two bratty dogs having a wild time.  It was really neat, and in a general sense reminded me a lot about my life from before in Ottawa.  Nice, active people, outdoorsy atmosphere, fun.  I miss that.</p>
	<p>Finally, I didn't take the MR2.  There is <em>no</em> way I could have properly taken care of it living in Old Montreal.  It's sad, but it's the right thing to do.  I was a bit heart-broken as we drove back to Ottawa to leave it with my brother and Dean, and even more sad when I started driving Joan's Matrix...  But I'll live.</p>
	<p>I biked in today.  Almost puked, need more sleep and more exercise.  Normally it's slightly less than an hour, I think it was an hour and fifteen minutes today.  Bleah.  I've been at work 11.5 hours now, and am about to bike home in the rain and dark.  Did fall come on fast, or what!?</p>
