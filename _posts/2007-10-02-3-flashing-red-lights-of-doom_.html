				<h1>3 flashing red lights of doom!</h1>
				<p>Finally... I eluded it so long I thought it was merely for lesser beings...<br/>
Someone play Taps... I had just made Sergeant, Grade 3.  I was going to push through to Gunnery Sergeant tonight, too.</p>
<p>The 360's <a title="Halo 3, we hardly knew ye." href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071121044713/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems">three red rings of death</a>.</p>
<p>Joan had picked it up for me as a Christmas present: just after release, and was only lucky enough to get this hot ticket item thanks to a snow storm. It served me well through Burnout (99% complete), Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, Halo 1 &amp; 2, Colin McRae, Tony Hawk Project Eight, lots of Xbox Arcade games, and recently, Guitar Hero 2 (x2, since you can't buy a second guitar without the game!) and the kiss of death (apparently) Halo 3.</p>
<p>First they thought it might have been the power supply.  If only.  Then they said 3-4 weeks.  The next call (5 minutes later)  where I validated it wasn't the power supply, it was 4-5 weeks.  Sigh.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Just to make things interesting, it's intermittent.  If it doesn't give the rings, it will lock up in Halo 3.  Which isn't covered by the extended 3-year warranty.  So now we have to hope the techs wherever are honest enough to try to find the 3-rings problem or I'll be out $110.  (US or CAN, who cares! <img src="icon_biggrin-3.html" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley"/> )</p>
<p>Right now GH2 is working, I wonder if Halo 3 would boot?</p>
<p>That way lies madness.</p>
<p><strong>Second Update</strong>: Now it works!  Jeebus!  Yay Halo 3!  Didn't want to ruin my ranking by disconnecting in Ranked games so I just played Rumble Pit for a while, not enough to rank up.

								<p>Nope, no problem with the iPhone.  You have to choose to take the update and I saw the problem coming from day one, before I'd actually managed to unlock it.  I was just afraid they'd push it without my permission.

								<p>I shall be the party pooper. What you're describing is exactly what happens before the 360 fails. It's only a matter of time, so keep the service call open <img src="../gif/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"/>  For me, it seems third times the charm (knocks wood).

								<p>Also, also, your Xbox should be covered for 3 years, so just keep playing it until it dies hard. <img src="icon_biggrin-3.html" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley"/>

								<p>Well, they're sending me the box, as after I spoke to support the first time they asked me to ensure the power supply wasn't the problem (if the 3 rings happen with a power supply showing orange, it is the power supply which is the problem).  </p>
<p>30 seconds after I got off the phone with the power-supply-suggesting CSR, consistent 3 rings and the power supply was green.  Consistently.  All this time I'm unplugging and replugging and changing games, etc.</p>
<p>So I make the 3 rings call, and 30 seconds after I get off the phone the 360 boots.  So I stick in GH2, figuring it's lightweight compared to Halo and get stuck on the 8th round of Hard (which is where I am stuck).  My forearm is sore from the wicked solos (15% on Carry Me Home on Hard! wooo!)  so I stick in Halo and it works... and it works... and it works...</p>
<p>My only concern is they'll try to charge me the $110.  And what will I do until it comes back?  Look for a used Core system and then resell it?

								<p>Oh by the by, only the 3 rings (Hardware failure) is covered for three years.  Lock-ups without the 3 rings are not covered.
