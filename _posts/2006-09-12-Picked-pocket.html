				<h1>Picked pocket</h1>
				<p>Sunday I got up earlier than I would have liked and headed off on my lonesome to meet up with the gang from Ottawa at McKenzie Pond, NY.  What an *awesome* day.  The weather was chill but I'd packed my down vest - besides, the last time we were there we complained it was too hot and humid. And I'd come back with a specific project in mind.</p>
<p>I'm nursing a weird injury.  I guess it's groin pull combined with a hamstring pull.  The groin thing has occurred in the past, every now and then.  Frankly it's never been a serious concern.  The hamstring's a little more serious as I've never done anything with it and it was immediately serious again the next time I stressed it a week later.</p>
<p>We warmed up on some Vnothings and everything felt okay.  Not great, but okay.  Frankly the only route that interested me in the first set was <code>Slobodan</code>, a V5,  but although the sending train was in motion I felt it would be something I wouldn't mind if my project went early and I wasn't hurting.</p>
<p>It was funny running into some people from Cornwall that the Ottawa guys new and then some people from Montreal that I kind of new by face.   Everyone was around <code>Ian's Favorite Problem</code>, so I was happy to get on <code>Slot Machine</code>, another V5.  It was actually something that Graham and I had looked at last time we were there - but this time it was dry.  I still needed to warm up, so we fired up the sending train and bam, it went first try.  Technically not a flash because of the attempts earlier in the wet conditions, but it was a great warmup and confidence builder...</p>
<p>Well, <code>Slot Machine</code>'s move pressured my groin a bit - but fortunately it was easy to get off the starting foot quickly.  We screwed around on the harder V8 sds just long enough to realize it wasn't going to be as much fun as the project.</p>
<p>So, <code>Contact</code> is a V8 on one of the last boulders at McKenzie Pond.  Graham, <a title="dave on contact, last time" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195958/http://www.pbase.com/gashford/image/62084690">Dave</a> and I had started working it last time - but it's a lot of contact strength and the moves are slowly sapping your strength every time you don't get it.  The less refined your movements are the more the slopey crimps turn into sharp crystals and edges, eager to cut through your skin.</p>
<p>Dave and I worked it while Pat and Chris and Alanna took a look at it and then took a more serious look at <code>Horshack</code> V7 and some other mossy mess that Chris took a high fall from.  (THUMP!)</p>
<p>Dave and I slowly pieced together the sequence, although slightly differently:  For me a straight-on, twist-your-feet and slow-your-motion thrust up to the first tiny sloping-crimper/crimping-sloper, for Dave a far drop-knee retard everything up onto that hold.  Then I'd pull in my left foot, get my wait underneath my right hand and move up to the next crappy hold.  Dave did something similar.  Now, both hands on crappy holds, campus up to a not-as-bad sloper that feels like heaven.  Get your feet on your starting holds and you're basically done: get both hands on the good final hold and suddenly many footholds are possible because even your feet are pass the worst of it, and you're in green-salad-land, bushes and moss everywhere send-territory.</p>
<p>Dave was done - what a great send - I think he's holding back on us!</p>
<p>For me, no luck.  My best attempt had me matching on the second last hold, bumping my right up to the last hold where I believe my left hand blew.  The barndoor motion threw me out - I had some recollection of trying to grab the hold again when my left foot blew.  Nothing was going to stop this barndoor from opening!  Pocket: picked.  My next best attempt had me trying to find positions to stop barndoors and ending up trying to use moss as rock.</p>
<p>A couple of more tries, a lot of superficial abrasions, the dropping temperature and long drives for everyone convinced me this little gem would take another fresh day to put down.</p>
<p>BTW, <code>Contact</code> is rated V8 - I've done one V7 and a couple of V6s, so I'd be very happy to send my hardest problem ever.</p>
<p>Post-Scripture:  Injury? What injury?!?  Working <code>Contact</code> I felt nothing.  Now, Monday, that was a different story.

								<p>I want to stress to everyone that I have never seen anyone get ripped off by a problem as much as J did!</p>
<p>He had that problem sent, without question, twice.  Both times the Boulder Gods just wanted a little more excitement at his expense, producing some of the loudest profanities ever bellowed in the Adirondacks!</p>
<p>This is what makes bouldering fun though.  If you sent everything all the time, you'd be looking for another sport.

								<p>I can't pretend to understand half of what you wrote, but it sounds like a pretty awesome time despite the bouldering gods being meanies. Is there a translation source where I can look up all the terms that made me wonder if I couldn't read?

								<p>You totally had that problem, J.  Next time it's going down.</p>
<p>I'd've been happy just to stick the first bloody move.

								<p>I'm sorry I missed the show!</p>
<p>This sounds like the type of problem that will get you back to the pond asap.  I experienced a similar frustration level on a problem in squamish.  I'm convinced this sort of thing will make a person a better climber.

								<p>It'll be quite the trophy on your list when it goes down...a nice looking line.  Here's some pics from that weekend, including one of you doing the last move.</p>
