				<h1>Pro-crastination.</h1>
				<p>You know you're avoiding <em>something</em> when you're commenting on your friends' blogs during working hours and you could be writing about how your vacation went, etc.   I think partially I'm reluctant to put thoughts down about the vacation - that would mean it's <em>really</em> over, after all - and partially over-tired and having a hard time concentrating.   Also milling about in my head are thoughts about what's going to happen.  Big changes are potentially in the wind, if nothing else, changing apartments.  And who knows what else.</p>
<p>(Aside, hit the climbing gym last night to do an inventory of the body: elbows are still tendonitissy, but better; finger tendon problems are still there; power is up, but sensitive because of previous issues; resistance is up; skin is well healed.  I was amazed to send a 19-move resistance problem late in the session, which I can normally only complete just after warming up.  Active heel hooks still suck, despite the helpful advice from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231606/http://videos.yakkul.com/">deech</a>, but what is really missing is the ab strength; the passive heel hooks are much improved.)</p>
<p>(Active: need to actively pull the heel toward you in order to retain the position or tension.  An extreme example is a double-heel hook like deech used on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231606/http://www.rockclimbing.com/photo/photo_show.php?id=18698">Hammerhead</a>, in that case climber is parallel to the ground, both heels are hooking towards each other in order to generate tension to hold themselves in place.  Passive: hang the heel on a hook or hold, allow gravity to pull you down, mechanically held in place, no muscle strength required)</p>
<p>I'm going to have to add a climbing category.  I think I'm happy about that <img src="../gif/icon_smile-2.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"/> .

								<p>At least we have it on good authority that procrastination is a necessary part of the creative process.  You gotta hang around with us more.
