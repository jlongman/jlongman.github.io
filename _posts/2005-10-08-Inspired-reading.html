				<h1>Inspired reading</h1>
					<p>I'm still pondering the last week. </p>
	<p>In the meantime, I've been doing quite a bit of reading about things that I never had to worry about at work.  I started with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023002419/http://www.vorbis.com/">Ogg</a>'s video, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023002419/http://www.theora.org/">Theora</a>.  Reminds me of some (much simpler) decoding I did at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023002419/http://www.discreet.com/">Discreet</a>.</p>
	<p>Discreet really was my first exposure to some real fundamentals.  It's unfortunate I didn't immerse myself in the C++ side – I think I really would have flourished there, especially after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023002419/http://www.raz.cx/blog">Roland</a> left.  The people there were really good about the high-level concepts and low-level nitty-gritty details of what they were doing.  Oh and possibly I could go back for a contract or a job or something – at least in the short-term <img src="../gif/icon_wink-3.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley"/> .</p>
	<p>After Theora, I thought of other cool software.  Browsing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023002419/http://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a>'s site – makers of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023002419/http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023002419/http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a>, two products I admire and would love to work on.</p>
	<p>Which led me to their open source projects: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023002419/http://opensource.atlassian.com/seraph">Seraph</a>, a website login technology, obviously used in Jira; which led to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023002419/http://acegisecurity.sourceforge.net/suggested.html">Acegi</a>, a more comprehensive login solution; which led to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023002419/http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/">Ehcache</a>, a cache used by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023002419/http://www.hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>, part of our persistence layer.</p>
	<p>Before I didn't really have a reason to check those out: Nic handled the server-side layer very well and my attentions were forced elsewhere (bug fixing is all I can remember – I've done <em>so</em> much bug-fixing lately – it's a running gag at the office...)</p>
	<p>So I got to sit down and do some reading.  Which is good, as I'll need to understand, if not those specific technologies then probably their basic principles.  Rather than dealing with it as a black box, I'll need to work with them, at least according to the current survey of job listings I've seen.  But really, I'm trying to figure out if that's really what I should be doing.</p>
	<p>One of the links, I'm not sure which, led to a PDF copy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023002419/http://www.manning.com/books/tate">Bitter Java</a>.  (I'll not link the PDF as I can't find a publisher's link to the full PDF, so it may be of questionable rights)  'Bitter Java' is an anti-patterns book for mostly server-side Java.   What I've read so far is pretty obvious, although it was interesting to read how these patterns appear server-side.   And to think of the implementations of the anti-patterns in the code that we've written.</p>
	<p>(There's a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023002419/http://www.deadsquid.com/">deadsquid</a> joke about bitterness and me – ahhhh, 'J's Best Bitter', alluding to a past drama in my relationships. )</p>
	<p>And also to think of the Anti-patterns that we've lived – say, the pattern that led to the company letting people go, and the pattern that resulted in the junior developers never developing fast enough—well, to satisfy me, at least.  </p>
	<p>While searching for a linkable copy of the PDF, I found 'Bitter Java''s author's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023002419/http://weblogs.java.net/blog/batate/">blog</a>, an amusing allegorical entry about his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023002419/http://weblogs.java.net/blog/batate/archive/2005/10/joe_the_amazing_1.html">pet monkey</a>, and a link to his next book, '<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061023002419/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596100949">Beyond Java</a>'.</p>
	<p>Which is my question:  What's beyond Java?  What's beyond Invidex? What's beyond today?  </p>
