				<h1>Ridiculous Booing Booing</h1>
				<p>I'm not certain I understand exactly what is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114427/http://www.boingboing.net/2006/02/24/ridiculous_product_t.html">ridiculous</a> about a toothbrush with replaceable bristles.  It's similar to a razor with replacable blades, except that typically that model is used in loss-leader economics.  On the other hand if using a replacable-bristle brush reduced landfill mass by two, wouldn't that be a good thing?</p>
<p>I was speaking with a McGill grad student many many moons ago at Bill and Nat's place, and she pointed out that many people can only perceive the impact of their 'tribe' - which is typically 20-30 people, but maybe I think for the 'well-connected' a hundred or so.  The problem with that is that you can't conceive of marginal environmental impact above the size of the tribe.  You can say that, if a tribe leaves a candy wrapper each, then my favourite park will become nasty.  But a tribe just walking through it won't leave any damage.   </p>
<p>But the truth is that a group many many many times your tribe walks through the park, doing much much more damage.  Which is why you should stay on the trail and try to use raised walkways or stone paths if they're available.  </p>
<p>So, getting back to toothbrushes, if my tribe reduces their toothbrush landfill mass by only two, who cares.  But if 100,000 x 'my tribe' reduce their toothbrush landfill mass by two...  Hardly ridiculous.

								<p>ok so a ‘refill' of 4 sets of bristles is going to cost how much? 4 blades is 10-15 bucks.</p>
<p>1$ for the brush and another say 50 bucks a year for bristles? no thanks.

								<p>There's no way you'd pay that much in a free market: the only value-added to a split brush is that it's better environmentally.  So the price would work out to the same or cheaper than current toothbrushes.</p>
<p>You make me think of a good point.  I think the most environmental and cheap way of shaving would be a straight edge.  And all those who didn't survive the first week could get Darwin Awards <img src="../gif/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"/> .  </p>
<p>I wonder if there's a renewable/environmentally friendly option for teeth?  Chewing on branches?

								<p>There is a Razor Conspiracy Theory out there that has Gilette and others suppressing the ceramic razor — the razor that never needs to be replaced.
