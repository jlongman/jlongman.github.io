				<h1>30 for 48</h1>
					<p>2/3 of the last 2 days has been spent at work.  And of course I woke up at 6:30 am with an idea.  Going to have to shut the window in my bedroom so I can keep it darker and quieter.  (That wasn't the idea â€“ the idea was to use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916043827/http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">checkstyle</a> to see if people are using our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916043827/http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;safe=off&amp;q=component+factory+pattern&amp;spell=1">ComponentFactory</a>.)</p>
