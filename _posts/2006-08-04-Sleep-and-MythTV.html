				<h1>Sleep and MythTV</h1>
				<p>As we speak, my MythTV box is turned off.  Probably the first time since it was installed.  The trick is, I upgraded the version of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195839/http://sourceforge.net/projects/nvram-wakeup">nvram-wakeup</a> on it, and in 10 minutes, it is supposed to wake itself up so it can record the next show.</p>
<p>You might think I would have done that a while ago, but the P4P800 wasn't supported by them until sometime 'recently'.  I'm not going to bother checking how recently, except it wasn't in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195839/http://www.mysettopbox.tv/CHANGELOG.txt">R5B7</a> release of Knoppmyth. (Although, maybe Knoppmyth's nvram-wakeup hadn't been upgraded since, '10-19-05, Release 5 Alpha 22â€³).</p>
<p>If it wasn't for the fact I added a whole bunch of Star Trek recording programs, as we're running out of episodial candidates of shows we are already recording, the duty cycle of the MythTV machine would be mostly idle.  So I'm hoping this will cut down on heat output as well as energy consumption.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed that the machine comes up in about 5 minutes.</p>

Oh, well.  I downloaded the correct conf file for the P4P800 - I had originally assumed that ALL configurations were included and it would just use the correct one (that seems obvious, doesn't it?) but apparently not.</p>
<p>Have to wait until the machine is idle in order to check it again. </p>

<p>There's a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212195839/http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Shutdown_Wakeup">Shutdown/Wakeup HOWTO</a> on the Mythtv Wiki that looks very good.  But it does point out that the machine won't shutdown if the frontend is still connected.  Argh.  What I want, of course, is for the the machine to shutdown if the UI has been idle and not playing for fixed period.  Sigh.
