				<h1>Politicks</h1>
				<p>Well, given that I'm in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231032/http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes/riding/107/">Westmount-Ville Marie</a> riding, I can vote any way I want and it doesn't matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2004, Liberal Lucienne Robillard won a third term in Westmount-Ville Marie with 56 per cent of the vote. She was first elected in a 1995 byelection in St-Henri-Westmount. [...]</p>
<p>The former St-Henri riding was Liberal from 1925 to 1974. Westmount was Liberal from 1940 to 1974, except for a PC win in 1958.  In the newly configured St-Henri-Westmount, Liberal Don Johnston, incumbent from Westmount, won in 1979, 1980 and 1984.  [...] . He left the Liberal caucus in 1988 to sit as an Independent. Liberal David Berger won in 1988 and 1993 but resigned in 1994.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Except for once in â€˜58, and then when an MP left the caucus, never to be re-elected, was the riding non-Liberal.  Westmount.   So it shouldn't surprise you I'm probably going to vote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231032/http://www.greenparty.ca/">Green</a>.  (Whatever happened to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231032/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros_Party_of_Canada">Rhino party</a>?)  Although I do find it strange that my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231032/http://ridings.greenparty.ca/article107.html?&amp;MMN_position=9:9">candidate</a> was born in 1980.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231032/http://imdb.com/title/tt0102250/quotes#qt0038382">1980</a>!</p>
<p>I still have to go through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231032/http://www.greenparty.ca/article70.html">platform</a>, but I'm pretty sure I can live with it.  Some of the things I heard on the CBC this morning sounded reasonable, in at least their spin sounded like the right things to do (e.g. remove subsidies to the (extremely profitable) petroleum industry (I love giving a succesful industry <em>more</em> money);  raise taxes on first-stage oil and gas production) even if they never would soon come to pass.</p>
<p>I understand the position that adding taxes to industries is supposed to stifle development.  I'd rather say it stifles 'easy development', or lowest-common-denominator development, the kind of industry the US is very good at doing.  High taxation and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231032/http://www.ec.gc.ca/NOPP/P2TUT/en/step3/rank/total.html">total</a>/<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231032/http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/BODY_FE310">full</a>-cost-accounting requires that the industry innovates, something I think North American society is less and less capable of doing.</p>
<p>It would be all well and good if the resources were renewable and the toxic effects of doing easy business were only minimal.  But they aren't and it's time the industry, the government and the people grew up and started paying the real price.  Because then they might start doing the little things that make a big difference rather than sit back on their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231032/http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/prb0511-e.htm">increasingly fat asses</a> waiting for their brain to go <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231032/http://www.fictionpress.com/read.php?storyid=259877">vestigial</a>.</p>

								<p>ummm... the green platform... seriously, what does it matter the platform if they never get a member elected?</p>
<p>However, vote your conscience. If somebody votes liberal they don't have a concience - they are unconscious!
