				<h1>Building the (New) Year's iCalendar</h1>
				<p>I'm not really a 'new year's resolution' kind of person - it doesn't really make sense to store up improvements you can make to yourself for the new year.  Why not start right away?</p>
<p>So I was scanning some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231459/http://www.treehugger.com/">TreeHugger</a> references, checking out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231459/http://www.sustain.ca/">some</a> of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231459/http://www.fabprefab.com/">cool prefab places</a> and it made me think that I'd missed a bunch of  home shows and bike shows and straw house events etc...</p>
<p>So I've started to put together an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231459/http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ical/">iCal</a> file which collects everything.  Eventually I'll get past the ssh IP filter on this machine and I'll try to stick it in a place where other people could share it.
