				<h1>Controllering</h1>
				<p>A co-worker asked me about whether slotch belonged in the model or the controller which led me to look for some kind of guiding principle to help him.  I came across an article called <a title="foo!" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070212200058/http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhatsaControllerAnyway">Whatsa Controller Anyway</a> on c2.com, which nicely covers a lot of ground and came up with this little gem:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps a band of disenfrachised ‘Three Amigo' wannabees have become standardless vigilantes on the open frontier. The lack of structured communication and deposition of formal definitions brings confusion to meaning. What began as deterministic science has morphed into new-speak adnauseum, exchanging science for conjecture and lack of order. Do we dialog with parallel contexts using similar terms, or do we fill variants with interlingual proposals, hoping that meaning will eventually evolve through use and acceptance?</p></blockquote>
<p>What fun!

								<p>Oh, 'slotch' is what my 2nd year Math Prof at Carleton used to use as a variable.  It was typically depicted as an octothorpe but could also be extended with another vertical slash and extending the horizontals.
