				<h1>Move block keybindings</h1>
				<p>Brilliant demonstration <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090722002935/http://flexgraphix.com/blog/?p=62#comment-300">here</a> to map a keybinding that will move an entire line or selected block up and down in a document  (see the comments more specifically).  This is a feature that's really handing in coding, and I REALLY miss it from IntelliJ's editor.  It seems like a lot of times I'm just trying to restore the functionality of IntelliJ (without the bloat and crashes that their support denied).  </p>
<p>Bit of a link dump: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090722002935/http://www.erasetotheleft.com/post/mac-os-x-key-bindings/">Source material</a> on keybindings in OSX</li>
<li>Same thing in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090722002935/http://thekitchentowel.blogspot.com/2009/02/xcode-user-scripts-to-duplicate-lines.html">User Scripts</a></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090722002935/http://www.cocoabits.com/KeyBindingsEditor/">Key Bindings Editor</a> is a user friendly way to acheive this</li>
</ul>
<p>And a caveat that if you have custom key bindings in xcode then it changes the rules a bit, and you need to look in the plist file.  Details are buried in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090722002935/http://www.obdev.at/products/completion-dictionary/index.html">Completion Dictionary</a> site, which might satisfy another need (automagic macros for log messages, for example).  </p>
<p>Another caveat if not using KeyBindingsEditor and cutting and pasting from the site is be careful about smart-quotes when pasting from the web!</p>
