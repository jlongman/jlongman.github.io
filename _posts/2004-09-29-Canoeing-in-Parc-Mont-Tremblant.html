				<h1>Canoeing in Parc Mont Tremblant</h1>
					<p>Leif, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060916044715/http://www.furius.ca/">Martin</a>, and I, with our respective '<em>chicas</em> '  &nbsp; <img src="../gif/icon_smile-45.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"/>  went up to Parc Mont Tremblant Saturday and canoe'd our brains out.  I haven't been in a canoe on anything besides a quiet lake in over 8 years, so it was interesting.  </p>
	<p>Joan has been a few times, but wasn't so good, but not so bad either.  At the end I finally figured out how to control the canoe with a weaker front â€“ in the end I thought she had more control over the direction than she had, so I was over-compensating.  Got a nice bit of sun, and it was fun to hang with peeps.  </p>
	<p>Nice to see Martin and meet his girlfriend, although we had to run off at the end due to dog commitments, oh and exhaustion. <img src="../gif/icon_smile-45.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"/> </p>
	<p>(My legs have been REALLY sore since then.  I expected the shoulders to hurt, but no problems there.  I would've thought it wouldn't be a problem because I've started biking, but 3 days of hell!)</p>
