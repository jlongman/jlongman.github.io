				<h1>When good music goes wrong...</h1>
				<p>Last.fm thinks I want to listen to a lot of 'emo' - any, 'post-hardcore' - any , 'progressive rock' â€” e.g. Spock's Beard , some Tom Jones,Garth Brooks, and generally a lot of crap.  Which is screwed up as yesterday it was bang on, playing some great stuff including The Postal Service, Belle and Sebastian, some Mozart, Le Tigre, some thing I guess would be called Asian Classical: Lei Quang, and so on.  I guess today my Neighbours' taste sucks!<br/>
:-P

								<p>I'm listening to lots of pandora - I can't really complain!  Never checked last.fm, though I've heard of it often.

								<p>Well, the thing is that I was on the 'neighbours' channel - and I guess I just hit the weirder neighbours.</p>
<p>In a way I find it reassuring that such diversity came up.  It's just... that's so not me.
