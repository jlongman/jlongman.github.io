				<h1>Linux and the M2NPV-VM</h1>
				<p>Quick note to record my annoyance.</p>
<p>The M2NPV-VM, with the latest firmware (1401), used with a linux kernel more recent than 2.6.18 and KVM_GUEST configured in the kernel will not work with USB.  Some details <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121212013919/http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0809.1/2179.html">here</a>.  Mythbuntu 9.10 is shipped with this configuration.  Generally, avoid 1401, also, from what I read.</p>
<p>I'd actually discovered that all a couple of weeks ago, but was pretty laissez-faire about usb until I realized my lirc config had been written over and was possibly on another drive - and the easiest way to attach and recover it would be via USB.  That was all prompted by the machine crashing after recording - which is why I also updated the firmware on my seagate drives about the same time.  </p>
<p>(Aside, my Seagate 1TB drives shipped limited by a jumper to 150Mb/s, but my mobo is supposed to be capable of 300 Mb/s.)</p>
