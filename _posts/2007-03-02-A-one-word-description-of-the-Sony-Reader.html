				<h1>A one word description of the Sony Reader</h1>
				<p>It's like using a <a title="no, really, except for the internet part" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114058/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">gopher</a>. No kidding, I'm 21 years old again, operating from the <a title="good times" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114058/http://www.cses.carleton.ca/">CSES</a> offices for pre-livesquid...  the FSECG.  Basically, you've got a tree, and at the leaves in the tree, there's a document.  The pages are slow to bring up, a half second maybe for each.  Sounds similar to gopher if you ask me.</p>
<p>There's more (well, any) graphics than that era, but most normal-sized PDFs look terrible on the small (SVGA) screen - they're basically unusable.  I admit they would've looked equally as bad on the  13″- or 15″-inch electron cannons we aimed at our faces for hours on days on years on end back in the gopher-era.</p>
<p>I don't know if I should be surprised but <a title="rich text format" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114058/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rtf">RTF</a>'s, which date from the same era, look better on the Reader.  I still have to check out unformatted TXT files and also some converted HTML to see what they look like.</p>
<p>Some side-lighting would have been nice.  Palm Pilots and cell phones and even Newtons got me used to back-lit reading at night while camping without having to use a headlamp.</p>
<p>When it's sitting there, especially at the menus, the display is _sexy_ looking.  ~162 DPI is not to be scoffed at. Speaking of the Newton, it's kinda nice to be back in greyscale again, kinda like going home to Pleasantville.</p>
<p>Next challenge:  wrest it away from my girlfriend so I can actually read something on it.</p>
<p>(A couple of things I've dumped on it:  ISO standards, TIFF 6.0, Why's Poignant Guide To Ruby, Thinking in Python, some Baen books.  I'll link these  (well the non-ISO ones) later, when it's not 1:30am)

								<p>...but only if the gopher interface fit in your pocket, I guess.  </p>
<p>I played with the Librie (the Reader's big brother) in Japan last year but the thought of hacking it into English, the restricted reading material from their site only (minus free stuff, of course) and the rather steep pricing dissuaded me very quickly.  Plus, it doesn't interface very nicely with a Mac, because Sony is dumb that way... Or that's how it seemed.</p>
<p>When ti comes to this kind of thing, I really wish there was a quick way to scan books (like ripping CDs). Or alternatively, to cheaply / freely download books you already own somehow. Oh well...</p>
<p>I really like the look of the screen, though, and the size is great for replacing a book... Me wanty, but I have other, more useful things to spend money on right now...</p>

								<p>Ya, if you could have your existing library immediately available on your reader it would be amazing.  </p>
<p>It's super usable with non-PDFs: RTF and the LRF format work really well.  It's a shame they don't have a good PDF reader, we're not talking rocket science here.</p>
<p>The funny thing with me and books is I go through periods where I don't touch them, and other periods where I'm burning the candle at both ends reading: reading late and waking up early to continue reading.  I imagine that period ends when the exhaustion catches up with me.</p>
<p>Still, I'm happy with it and I wish I had time to actually read the 20 books I've put on there so far.  Most of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114058/http://www.craphound.com/" rel="nofollow">Doctorow's</a> stuff, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070924114058/http://www.manybooks.net/" rel="nofollow">Manybooks</a>'s many different formats (including LRF) (Gutenburg-based, IIRC), various free documents, etc.

								<p>Mmm. there's some good stuff there... Maybe I need to go shopping. <img src="../gif/icon_smile-22.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"/> </p>
<p>Out of curiosity, does the Sony format at Manybooks read any better than LRF?

								<p>Have you by any chance checked out Sony's Connect site?  That takes me back... <img src="../gif/icon_wink-20.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley"/>   You'd think they could do better...

								<p>The Sony format at Manybooks *is* LRF, apparently...</p>
<p>Which generally is fast.  I've not seen complex examples but mostly I've been reading books which have simple layout requirements.  RTF is fast but lays out simply, once an initial layout is done.  Only PDF is slow.</p>
<p>So better...?
