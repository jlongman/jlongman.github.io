				<h1>Ethernet woes on OS X</h1>
				<p>Seriously - do an OS update and your ethernet stops working...! Claims the cable isn't plugged in.  (I should point out that this is a Leopard, a point update, and not a Snow Leopard upgrade)</p>
<p>But it's the same cable, it used to work, and oh, my Xbox 360 still works using it.  Hmmm...  This sounds suspicious.  A quick search shows the problem is not uncommon and the general solution is to shorten the cable, cause OS X is — apparently — 'picky'.  Yes, I am running a long cable.  I can't shorten the cable - this is where I need to access the remote boxes from  (my apartment is long).</p>
<p>Here's the compromise that worked for me.  Go to the Ethernet device in Network settings in System Preferences (click on the Airport radiating fan, last option), choose Advanced, then the last tab, which should be Ethernet.   Change the combobox value for Configure: to 'Manually'.   Choose the top option (should be 10BT or 10BaseT or something like that).  Hit OK, then Apply.  See if you get an IP and it starts to work (it did for me).  Try higher options until it goes red again.  (Only 10BaseT worked for me, so nothing higher ever worked).  I also tried to fiddle with the duplex options but it didn't seem to work.</p>
<p>Maybe it was auto-negotiated down to a 10Mbit/s before, but now it's not auto-negotiating it.</p>

								<p>Besides that, how was the rest of the upgrade.  I haven't really found a reason to go ahead yet.</p>

								<p>I edited the post to indicate it was an update and not an upgrade (i.e. from 10.5.7 to 10.5.8).  I haven't found a copy in montreal yet (haven't looked hard, tho).</p>
<p>I am now having misery with my wifi on my other machine, but it could just be interference in Old Montreal.</p>
