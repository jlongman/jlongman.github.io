				<h1>Shaving the Mitch</h1>
					<p>Oh, the other thing I did this weekend (Sunday actually) was shave Mitch.  He was pretty patient considering.  For such a neurotic dog he was great.  </p>
	<p>(He likes to be hand fed, he likes to drink his water from my water glasses <del>- fortunately I haven't taken a drink from a glass that he's had already, yet and as far as I know</del>- the list goes on.)</p>
	<p>I got his body, but not his head, and some of it looks hacked, as I was trying to take the volume off and then trim the bottom later to make it easier on him, but he looked like he'd had enough.</p>
