				<h1>Full moon in Montreal</h1>
				<p>I witnessed about 7 acts of sheer stupidity in about 20 minutes of driving.  In one case, it was just the end result of stupidity.  I didn't see the crash detritus as I was driving, but Jen was wondering how it could have been so severe for the intersection of Guy? and de Maisonneuve - you really shouldn't be driving fast there.</p>
<p>Other witnessed things include turning left by running a red light and crossing two lanes of traffic (it's okay as long as you honk and squeal the tires), entering the intersection and blocking the oncoming lanes to turn left on a fast street, honking and getting mad at me so they can turn on a straight arrow, etc, etc, etc...</p>
<p>Full moon indeed...</p>
<p>I don't understand why they don't turn the downtown core into a car-hostile environment.  That's the area of montreal with the highest density of public transit and if you could bike (and safely leave your bike somewhere) it would be ideal.  Especially with this weather.  (snow?  what's that?)
