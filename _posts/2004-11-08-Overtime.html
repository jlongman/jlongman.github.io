				<h1>Overtime</h1>
					<p>I was going back over my logged hours in September, and actually I based it on my CVS comments, so it could be less than what I actually did, but I logged 65 hours in the second week, and 66.5 hours in the third week of September.  I stopped doing the totals then.</p>
	<p>I am, incidentally, done with this streak,  just now on friday.  I actually had 'nothing' to do.  (Well, I had a few UI things to do for 7.1, to make sure it is done right, and I do have some research to do if I want to look at some of the rule-based systems...)</p>
	<p>Anywho, I'm trying to think how much money I would have made if my time was billable.  That way madness lies.   Or a new job, one of the two.</p>
