				<h1>Family in Ottawa</h1>
				<p>I blasted through Ottawa with Joan this weekend to see my mom who was up from the US of A, my sister up from TO and to see my brother and his family (who are in Greely).   We stayed in Stittsville, where Graham kindly let us stay while he was at Smuggler's Notch, bouldering.</p>
<p>It was a blast, great to see the kids, especially now that Derek has a bit more personality and Dean's a whirlwind.  </p>
<p>Alas, that meant no time for the myth box, but that's alright as it finally came together.  I did re-install it, and once I figgered the little things that had changed, it was all good.  </p>
<p>I'm now wondering if a P4 will throttle itself energy-wise appropriately when idle.  I did have an Athlon in there, which using '<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231256/http://http//members.jcom.home.ne.jp/jacobi/linux/softwares.html">athcool</a>', may have been the better energy-wise choice.  Especially since I don't recall ACPI on Linux being friendly with my P4 mobo.</p>
<p>(We have a couple of hours of Simpsons recorded...)
