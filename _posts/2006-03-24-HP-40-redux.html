				<h1>HP 40 redux</h1>
				<p>(Hard to say this is redux, unless you refer to the last time I was there - and the only record of that that I have is either printed on pictures or on <i>n</i>-year old videotape.  I must dig up.  Enihoo...)</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231616/http://www.engsoc.org/~awall/2006mar11hp40.htm">awall's list</a>, these are my from-memory ticks.  There's no point in tracking Flashes as I have no recollection of what I've tried in the previous visit.  E.g. I know that I tried The Crown many times last time, and this time I flew up it (twice in a row, once without the <abbr title="Sit Down Start">SDS</abbr>, since I forgot the start).  I'm sure I got on Wasp before too, but similarly, no probs this trip.  </p>
<p>Back to the point:</p>

<p>That I did do so well, I think, speaks well of the company I was with - encouraging and helpful.   <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231616/http://www.pbase.com/gashford/image/57616529">Deech</a>'s pointer about toe placement for heel hooks was spot on; working problems with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231616/http://www.pbase.com/gashford/image/57616343">Mel</a> on our own for abit; the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231616/http://www.pbase.com/gashford/image/57616489">other-dave</a>'s flash of Sandbox!; watching <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231616/http://www.pbase.com/gashford/image/57616527">Kathy</a> be so t&ecirc;teux â€” hmmm, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231616/http://www.pbase.com/gashford/image/57616532">Chris</a> too!;  I feel pretty compatible with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231616/http://www.pbase.com/gashford/image/57616520">Pat</a>, despite my height advantage; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231616/http://www.pbase.com/gashford/image/57616172">Jen and awall</a>'s long-limbed, low-power, smarts; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070207231616/http://www.pbase.com/gashford/image/57616535">G</a> - you've just gotten so 'good'.  And also the foundation I picked up from John, back in the day.</p>
<p>However, upon reviewing this list, I feel I played it conservatively. 16 problems over 6 climbing days.  (0.5 = rest day but we climbed at night,  and less another 0.5 versus those who actually climbed the last Saturday),  2.6 problems a day.   The median level is probably V2 which is alright but I would have been happier with V3.  Losing all my tips last time, having the elbow problems at Font (and again this time), ripping the skin off the tip of my big toe the first day  (don't ask) and just not believing in myself until the end.  I'm not unhappy with my performance,and I did respect my limitations, I <em>have</em> to, but I know I can do 'better'.  </p>
<p>It would help a lot if my climbing regime (i.e. Allez-Up's bouldering, which is where I am all the time) wasn't so limited.  No top-outs to speak of, no mantling at all.  My footwork needs work, especially wrt active heel hooks and abdominal strength.   My flow still feels awkward.  But these things can be addressed.</p>
<p>Generally, I had a hard time coming home - it was <em>so</em> good and fun and easy down there.  Also, warm and sunny.  Come to think of it, I've yet to reconcile a good trip without having post-vacation blues.

								<p>When you break it down to # problems per day, it doesn't seem like we climbed a heck of a lot.  </p>
<p>But we did climb a lot!    </p>
<p>I enjoyed (probably more than I should have) the lazing about at camp before climbing, the unusually long warmup sessions and the time spectating / socializing.</p>
<p>I think we need another week there to work projects.

								<p>It's true I'm counting <em>sent</em> problems a day - not so bad, if they were V7. <img src="../gif/icon_smile-2.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"/>   </p>
<p>My elbows are testament to the amount of climbing we actually did per day.  I'm not happy I had to turn down climbs because of the topouts because that is one aspect I really need to work on.  I know I was especially unhappy about the climbs when we were night climbing that I had to turn down because of the topouts and my elbows.</p>
<p>Definitely need more time to work projects.
